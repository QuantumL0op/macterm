ABOUT THE MACTELNET PROJECT
  Welcome to this source release of MacTelnet for Mac OS X!
  
  MacTelnet's goal is to be an excellent terminal emulation
  program for Mac OS X, while also being very easy to use.  It
  streamlines terminal work on both local and remote machines,
  by giving the user just the right set of powerful features, a
  smart set of preferences and convenient window management.
  
  The project is written in C++ with its roots in regular C (so
  a lot of code still looks more like plain C - and this is not
  always a bad thing!).  As of MacTelnet 3.1 the application is
  also entirely managed by a Python interpreter: APIs are not
  only exposed to Python (through SWIG), but it is possible to
  implement parts of MacTelnet using only Python!
  
  Python, Perl, shell scripts and GNU makefiles are also used for
  various infrastructure and the documentation utilities.
