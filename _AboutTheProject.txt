ABOUT THE MACTELNET PROJECT
  Welcome to this source release of MacTelnet for Mac OS X!
  
  MacTelnet's goal is to be an excellent terminal emulation
  program for Mac OS X, while also being very easy to use.  It
  streamlines terminal work on both local and remote machines,
  by giving the user just the right set of powerful features, a
  smart set of preferences and convenient window management.
  
  The project is now structured as a C/C++/Objective-C++ library
  that is bound to Python through SWIG.  This allows Python to be
  used for implementing core features and user extensions.
  
  Python, Perl, shell scripts and GNU makefiles are also used for
  various infrastructure and the documentation utilities.
