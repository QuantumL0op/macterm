h1(pagetitle). Types of Windows

<div class="content">

h2(#terminal). Terminal

A terminal window is what you will use most in MacTelnet.  It
displays a primarily-text interface to the applications you are
running.

There are so many things you can do with terminal windows that
there is a "dedicated page":terminals.html discussing them all!

h2(#commandline). Command Line

The command line is a special interface to the active terminal
window.  See "the terminals page":terminals.html#commandline for more information.

h2(#tek). Tektronix Vector Graphics

If a session has a TEK graphics command set enabled, it will
automatically spawn Tektronix vector graphics drawings whenever
properly-formatted data is received from the session.

A drawing can be copied to the Clipboard using Edit >> Copy.  It
can be magnified or shrunk by resizing its window.  A portion of
the graphic can be magnified by using the mouse to drag a rectangle.
(This partial view can be undone by double-clicking the graphic.)

**Note:** Currently, an open graphic will hijack all interaction with
the terminal that generated it: for example, typing into the
terminal will cause the text to be rendered graphically in the TEK
window instead.  Close the graphics window to restore ordinary
terminal behavior.

h2(#sessioninfo). Session Info

Displays the status of all windows at once, including whether or
not processes are running.  There are icons in the Window menu
that show similar information.

h2(#macros). Macro Editor

The macro editor allows you to define text short-cuts that can be
"typed" for you, when certain keys are pressed.  In MacTelnet 3.1
this is a fully modeless window, allowing you to edit macros in
real time without having to commit changes to any dialog.

The set of 12 macros visible in the editor is the active set; you
can keep up to 5 sets in memory at once (and save others, using
the "Export..." and "Import..." abilities).

The "Invoke With:" section lets you choose whether your macros
are invoked with numeric command keys (command-0, command-1,
etc.) or with the top row of function keys (F1, F2, etc.).

Use the "Special Sequences..." button to see how placeholders can
be put into macro text for arbitrary characters as well as tabs,
quotes, newlines, escapes, your computer's IP address and the
number of lines in your terminal.

h2(#keypads). Keypads

MacTelnet provides a number of powerful keypad windows.  Clicking
a keypad button is equivalent to typing the key or key sequence
it represents.  However, keypad buttons __always__ send the right
character code or character sequence, even in cases where the
keyboard might not work (because of a terminal mode or a
conflicting Mac OS X keyboard mapping, etc.).

**Tip:** On later versions of Mac OS X, MacTelnet will allow you
to navigate keypad keys using the keyboard.  By default, you use
Control-F1 to turn on Full Keyboard Access and Control-F6 to give
keyboard focus to one of the floating keypad windows.

h3(#controlkeys). Control Keys

This is a floating window providing access to 32 control key
combinations, "invisible" characters of the ASCII character set.
These keys are frequently useful in terminals and therefore are
likely to trigger special responses when used.

h3(#functionkeys). VT220 Function Keys

This is a floating window providing access to the function keys
of a VT220 terminal.  MacTelnet will not prevent their use when
you have selected a terminal emulator other than VT220, however
your session may respond oddly to the input.

For completeness the keypad shows F1-F5, however these are not
available (they have meaning to a real VT220 terminal, but not an
emulated terminal).

Unless you have used the macro editor to map your keyboard's
function keys to macros, they will map to VT220 function keys by
default.  Each key is __offset by 5__, so your keyboard F1 maps
to the VT220 F6, and your keyboard F15 maps to the VT220 F20.

h3(#vt220keypad). VT220 Keypad

This is a floating window providing access to the special keypad
functions of a real VT220 terminal.  MacTelnet will not prevent
their use when you have selected a terminal emulator other than
VT220, however your session may respond oddly to some of the
keys.

You can use the "Show Help Tags" command of the Help menu in
MacTelnet to enable contextual descriptions of the buttons; then
point your mouse at one of the VT220 Keypad icons to see what it
means.
