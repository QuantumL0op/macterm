h2(#terminal). Terminal

A terminal window is what you will use most in MacTerm.  It
 displays a primarily-text interface to other applications.

There are so many things you can do with terminal windows that
 there is a "dedicated page":terminals.html discussing them all!

h2(#tek). Tektronix Vector Graphics

If a session has a TEK graphics command set enabled, it will
 automatically spawn Tektronix vector graphics drawings whenever
 properly-formatted data is received from the session.  You may
 also create pages using View >> New TEK Page.

**Note:** Once a graphics window is opened, its terminal is tied
 to the canvas and any typing in the terminal will be rendered in
 the graphics window only.  To restore normal terminal behavior,
 close the graphics window.

What you can do with a graphics window:

* Edit >> Copy to copy a bitmap of the graphic to the clipboard.
* Magnify or shrink the image by resizing the window.
* Focus on one part by dragging a rectangle with the mouse.  You can undo this focus by double-clicking the image.

h2(#serverbrowser). Server Browser

The Servers panel appears when the "Server Settings..." button
 is clicked (either in the File >> Custom New Session... sheet, or
 when editing the equivalent panel in the Preferences window).
 Changes to the panel will automatically write an appropriate
 command line, in the window whose button was most recently used
 to activate the panel.

What you can do with the Servers panel:

* Browse for any services that were discovered by your computer.
* Enter connection details manually.

A remote application is accessed over a *connection* (which uses
 a particular "protocol") to an exact *port* (number) on a *host*
 (computer).  You can also identify yourself with a *user ID*, if
 the server requires one.

To start, make a selection from the "Connection:" menu.  This
 will automatically assign a default port number.  (You may need
 to ask an administrator which choice is appropriate.)

It may be possible to simply browse for a service instead of
 entering connection details manually.  To try this, click the
 "Find a Server..." button, which will display a drawer that
 begins to list anything that was found by your computer for the
 type of Connection you selected in the menu.  Click any item in
 the list to copy its Host and Port information.  Double-click
 to automatically close the drawer in the process.

If the service you want is not listed, you need to fill in the
 panel manually.  (You may want to ask an administrator for help.)

In the Host field, you can enter a name like "apple.com" if one
 is applicable; if you have only an address, like "123.45.67.123",
 enter that instead.  The Look Up button can be used to check if a
 server name is valid (if so, it is transformed into a numeric
 address; otherwise, it is unchanged).

bq. MacTerm supports IP version 6 addresses too, so
 you could also enter something like
 "0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:9d16:0164".

The Port field may not require changing...it is set automatically
 when you choose a Connection type.  But some servers use a custom
 port number, so adjust the value if necessary.

The User ID is how the server identifies you.  If not provided,
 the name of your local Home folder is used (one-word,
 all-lowercase).  Note that if a password is also required to
 access the server, you will be prompted for that at connection
 time; you cannot enter it initially in the configuration sheet.

h2(#sessioninfo). Session Info

Displays the status of all windows at once, including whether or
 not processes are running.  There are icons in the Window menu
 that show similar information.

To bring a window to the front, you can double-click its entry in
 the Session Info list.

To rename a window, select the appropriate item in the list and
 press Return to display an edit box (as you would in the Finder).
 This is equivalent to using the Window >> Rename command.

Hovering the mouse over the Status column can show a few
 different text descriptions:

* **Running (just opened):** It has only been a few seconds since the window opened, so you can close it without warning.
* **Running:** The session has been open for awhile; MacTerm will confirm when you try to close it.
* **Not Running:** The application running in the window has quit, but the window is still open; only possible when you have set the "Don't automatically close windows" preference.

An icon is also displayed, and normally matches the text above;
 but, it can sometimes change to show a transient state:

* A yellow caution icon indicates an open alert message, or that a notification is up (for example, a watch for activity in a window).
* A "dimmed" icon indicates the window was hidden from view with the Hide command.  (Hidden windows can be redisplayed in many ways, including double-clicking Session Info list items.)

You can rearrange the columns in this window and your preferred
 order will be saved automatically.

Note that View >> Hide Toolbar and View >> Customize Toolbar also
 work for the Session Info window, and can be used to change your
 display preferences for the top of that window.

h2(#commandline). Command Line

The command line is a special interface to the active terminal
 window.  See "the terminals page":terminals.html#commandline for more information.

h2(#ipaddr). IP Addresses of This Mac

Using Window >> IP Addresses of This Mac or the equivalent command
 from MacTerm's Dock menu, you can display a floating window
 with a list of IPv4 and/or IPv6 addresses for your computer's
 network interfaces.

Each item in the list can be dragged with the mouse and dropped
 (into a terminal window, for instance), to type in that address.

See also the Macros pane in the Preferences window, which can be
 used to define macros with text substitution (of the @\i@
 sequence) that include one of your computer's IP addresses.

h2(#keypads). Keypads

MacTerm provides a number of powerful keypad windows.  Clicking
 a keypad button is equivalent to typing the key or key sequence
 it represents.  However, keypad buttons __always__ send the right
 character code or character sequence, even in cases where the
 keyboard might not work (because of a terminal mode or a
 conflicting Mac OS X keyboard mapping, etc.).

**Tip:** On later versions of Mac OS X, MacTerm will allow you
 to navigate keypad keys using the keyboard.  By default, you use
 Control-F1 to turn on Full Keyboard Access and Control-F6 to give
 keyboard focus to one of the floating keypad windows.

h3(#controlkeys). Control Keys

This is a floating window providing access to 32 control key
 combinations, "invisible" characters of the ASCII character set.
 These keys are frequently useful in terminals and therefore are
 likely to trigger special responses when used.

h3(#functionkeys). VT220 Function Keys

This is a floating window providing access to the function keys
 of a VT220 terminal.  MacTerm will not prevent their use when
 you have selected a terminal emulator other than VT220, however
 your session may respond oddly to the input.

For completeness the keypad shows F1-F5, however these are not
 available (they have meaning to a real VT220 terminal, but not an
 emulated terminal).

Unless you have used the macro editor to map your keyboard's
 function keys to macros, they will map to VT220 function keys by
 default.  Each key is __offset by 5__, so your keyboard F1 maps
 to the VT220 F6, and your keyboard F15 maps to the VT220 F20.

h3(#vt220keypad). VT220 Keypad

This is a floating window providing access to the special keypad
 functions of a real VT220 terminal.  MacTerm will not prevent
 their use when you have selected a terminal emulator other than
 VT220, however your session may respond oddly to some of the
 keys.

You can use the "Show Help Tags" command of the Help menu in
 MacTerm to enable contextual descriptions of the buttons; then
 point your mouse at one of the VT220 Keypad icons to see what it
 means.
