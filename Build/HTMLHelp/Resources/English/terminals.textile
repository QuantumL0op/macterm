<div class="content">
<a name="helpwithterminalsettings"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

h2(#select). Text Selections

Highlight terminal text by dragging over it with the mouse.  Keep
it *rectangular* by holding down the Option key.

h3(#selectdrag). Drag and Drop

Text can be copied by using the mouse to move a selection to
another location - for instance, the Desktop (to make a text
clipping).

Text can be imported in the same way - any text dropped into a
terminal is effectively typed into the terminal.

The Unix pathname of a file or folder can be typed by dropping
the icon (from the Finder, say) into a terminal.

h3(#selectappearance). Text Selection Preferences

See "the Preferences page":preferences.html for some options related to the
appearance and behavior of text selections.  For instance, you
can choose to have them automatically copied to the clipboard.

h3(#arrange). Terminal Search

<a name="helpsearchingfortext"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

The Edit >> Find... command allows *dynamic* search of the entire
contents of a terminal (main screen and scrollback).  The dialog
has a special minimalist design so that it won't cover any search
results.

As you type, every match for the forming pattern is immediately
found and highlighted, in a special way that does not cancel any
other text selection in the window.  In addition, red tick marks
appear on the scroll bar, showing you where you can find even
more matches in the scrollback buffer.

For performance reasons, single-character searches are not
dynamic, although you can still close the dialog to initiate a
one-character search.

The "A=a" checkbox, again an abbreviated interface, simply makes
the search case-insensitive.

The history menu allows you to access any previously accepted
queries for the current terminal window.  If you do not use the
default button when closing a search, your query is discarded and
any previous search's highlighting is restored.

You can draw attention to individual results in turn by using the
Edit >> Find Next command (and via modifier key, Find Previous).

h2. Cursor

The cursor is a special position in the bottommost screenful of a
terminal, representing (usually) where text will appear when you
type.

h3(#findcursor). Finding the Cursor

Use Edit >> Find Cursor to create a homing animation that tells
you where the terminal cursor is in the active window.  This can
be useful at times when the cursor is hard to see amongst several
lines of text.

h3(#cursorappearance). Cursor Preferences

See "the Preferences page":preferences.html for some options related to the
appearance and behavior of the cursor.  For instance, you can
choose its shape and whether or not it is flashing on and off.

h2(#commandline). Floating Command Line

<a name="helpusingthefloatingcommandline"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

Use Window >> Command Line to display a floating window for
entering text locally.  Unlike typing directly into a terminal,
nothing you type in the floating window is seen until you press
the *Return* key (which also sends a new-line sequence to the
terminal).

You can use the down-arrow key or the mouse to access a list of
previously-entered command lines.  The field supports the usual
Mac editing short-cuts, such as option-left-arrow to skip to the
previous word.  It also supports some shell-like short-cuts, such
as control-A and control-E to jump to the beginning and end,
respectively.

The colors of the command line are read from your Default Format
preferences when the window is first displayed.

h2. Window Operations

MacTelnet provides many sophisticated ways to manage windows.

h3(#dimensions). Screen Sizes

<a name="helpsettingthescreensize"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

Some applications that run in terminals will either assume one of
a few standard sizes, or have issues at certain (typically large)
sizes; for instance, text editors may run out of memory with wide
terminals.  While MacTelnet does not restrict your window size,
it does provide a few short-cut commands to let you immediately
change to common sizes (80x24, 80x48, 132x24).

You may also open a dialog to choose a specific number of rows
and columns.  Note that Edit >> Undo can be used to cancel
dimension changes made with these commands.

If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can hold down the Option
key and use the wheel to increase or decrease the terminal rows
(or terminal columns, if your wheel can be moved horizontally).
You can also adjust terminal columns by holding down both the
Option and Command keys when using the vertical scroll wheel.

Depending on your "Window Resize Effect" preferences, dragging
the size box with or without the Option key will also change the
terminal screen dimensions.

h3(#magnify). Magnification

Use View >> Make Text as Big as Possible to alter a terminal's
text size based on the display that contains the largest part of
its window!

If your mouse has a scroll wheel, you can hold down the Control
key and use the wheel to increase or decrease the text size.

It is also possible to magnify text as you resize a window or
as you enter Full Screen mode.  The result depends on your
"Window Resize Effect" preference setting, and whether or not you
have held down the Option key to temporarily change it.

Note that Edit >> Undo can be used to cancel dimension changes
made with the "Make Text..." commands.

h3(#hide). Hiding Windows

A window can be hidden from view while it is still open, allowing
you to reduce clutter without disturbing active commands or
remote connections.  Note that if you Option-click another window
the active terminal will automatically hide before activating the
new window.

h3(#arrange). Arranging Windows

When arranged, _all_ terminal windows return to a diagonal
stagger pattern that matches their original opening positions.
NOTE that this cannot be undone.

h3(#arrange). Session-Induced Window Changes

MacTelnet respects some of XTerm's window sequences, so a
terminal application may also affect a window.  Typically an
application will rename the window or minimize it into the Dock.
