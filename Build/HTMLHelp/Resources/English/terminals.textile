<div class="content">

h2. Text Selections

Highlight terminal text by dragging over it with the mouse.  Keep it
*rectangular* by holding down the Option key.

h3(#selectdrag). Drag and Drop

Text can be copied by using the mouse to move a selection to another
location - for instance, the Desktop (to make a text clipping).

Text can be imported in the same way - any text dropped into a
terminal is effectively typed into the terminal.

The Unix pathname of a file or folder can be typed by dropping the
icon (from the Finder, say) into a terminal.

h3(#selectappearance). Text Selection Preferences

See "the Preferences page":preferences.html for some options related to the
appearance and behavior of text selections.  For instance, you can
choose to have them automatically copied to the clipboard.

h2. Cursor

The cursor is a special position in the bottommost screenful of a
terminal, representing (usually) where text will appear when you type.

h3(#findcursor). Finding the Cursor

Use Edit >> Find Cursor to create a homing animation that tells
you where the terminal cursor is in the active window.  This can
be useful at times when the cursor is hard to see amongst several
lines of text.

h3(#cursorappearance). Cursor Preferences

See "the Preferences page":preferences.html for some options related to the
appearance and behavior of the cursor.  For instance, you can
choose its shape and whether or not it is flashing on and off.

h2(#commandline). Floating Command Line

Use Window >> Show Command Line to display a floating window
for entering text that _is not_ immediately sent to the active terminal
as you type.

Instead, the text is sent in one of two ways:

* By hitting *Return*, which sends what's entered so far,
  followed by a new-line sequence, to the active terminal

* By hitting *Tab*, which sends only the text (no new-line)

The command line also supports a small history of past lines of text
that you have entered; you can either press the up-arrow key or use
the pop-up menu to access them.

As a special peculiarity, MacTelnet will allow you to enter a
URL (http://www.apple.com/, telnet://nowhere.loopback.edu/, etc.)
into the command line, and if you do it will **not** be sent to the
active terminal.  Instead, it will be handled by your system,
running whatever helper application is most appropriate (for
example, your preferred web browser).

h2. Window Operations

MacTelnet provides many sophisticated ways to manage windows.

h3(#dimensions). Screen Sizes

The View menu contains a couple of short-cut commands that let you
immediately change a terminal window to one of the standard sizes
(80x24, 132x24), and you may also open a dialog to choose a specific
number of rows and columns.  If you drag the resize box of the
window, the rows and columns are changed dynamically (with a pop-up
showing the dimensions as you drag).

h3(#magnify). Magnification

Use View >> Make Text as Big as Possible to alter a terminal's text
size based on the display that contains the largest part of its window!
See also View >> Full Screen, which can be used in tandem with
this effect to create a dedicated terminal display (kiosk).  If you
Option-drag the resize box of the window, the text is magnified
dynamically (with a pop-up showing the font size as you drag).

h3(#hide). Hiding Windows

A window can be hidden from view while it is still open, allowing
you to reduce clutter without disturbing active commands or
remote connections.  Note that if you Option-click another window
the active terminal will automatically hide before activating the
new window.

h3(#arrange). Arranging Windows

When arranged, _all_ terminal windows return to a diagonal stagger
pattern that matches their original opening positions.  NOTE that
this cannot be undone.

h3(#arrange). Session-Induced Window Changes

MacTelnet respects some of XTerm's window sequences, so a terminal
application may also affect a window.  Typically an application will
rename the window or minimize it into the Dock.
