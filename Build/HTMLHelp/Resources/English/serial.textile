h1(pagetitle). Using Serial Ports

notextile. <div class="content">

p(#abstract). MacTelnet does *not* yet support serial ports directly, but you
 can easily use GNU "screen" to do it.  This tutorial will help
 you make settings appropriate for a basic device connection.

h2. Overview

GNU "screen" is a program that, among other things, is its own
 terminal emulator.  It has many powerful features (for instance,
 it lets you open multiple terminals in one window, as an
 alternative to MacTelnet's tabs).

In the case of this tutorial, "screen" is used because its
 terminals have the ability to directly communicate with devices
 such as serial ports.

h2. Configuration

h3. Session

When the Sessions pane (or sheet) is visible, you will see a
 "Command:" field.  In it, enter a command similar to the
 following:

    /usr/bin/screen  /dev/tty...  9600

You should *substitute* the values above as appropriate for your
 connection.

The path indicates the device to use.  For instance, you might
 say "/dev/tty.Bluetooth-Modem" to connect to your modem.  You can
 run "ls /dev/tty*" in a shell to see other options, or follow the
 guidance of the device manufacturer.

It is also possible to use "call Unix" versions of some devices,
 typically under paths like /dev/cu*.  Which you need depends on
 what you are doing: /dev/tty* is typical, for dial-in behavior,
 and /dev/cu* is for dial-out behavior.  Note that once you start
 using a dial-in (/dev/tty) device, that path is not available
 for any other use until you are finished, whereas /dev/cu*
 equivalents can continue to be used while the /dev/tty* version
 is open.

The number is _optional_, and refers to the baud rate (bits per
 second) of both send and receive.  If you don't know what this
 should be for the device, try omitting it entirely; or, use one
 of the more common values such as 9600, 19200, 1200 or 300.

h2. Interaction

Once the session starts, you are actually running inside a
 "screen" session, so all of its commands are available.  It can
 be helpful to use MacTelnet's macros feature to create short-cuts
 for some of the "screen" features that you use more frequently.

Since you are directly connected to a device, anything you enter
 must follow the device's protocol, or properly interact with
 whatever driver software is running.

See "the screen man page":x-man-page://screen for more details on how to drive a
 "screen" session.
