h2(#servers). Remote Sessions: Connecting to Servers

Select File >> Custom New Session... to begin.

bq. Only your first sessions should require this
customization step.  In the future, it will be faster
to rely on a Favorite or a saved session file to hold
your preferences.  A Favorite can be opened directly
from the File menu; for others, use File >> Open.

A Custom New Session opens a terminal window and a sheet to allow
configuration.

This sheet is identical to the equivalent panel of the Preferences
window, so just review the "preferences documentation":preferences.html#sessionresource for more.

Unlike Preferences, changes to the sheet are temporary and can
be either discarded or committed using the sheet's buttons.

h2(#unix). Local Sessions: Running Unix Commands

As with remote applications, File >> Open... can be used to run a
command that you previously saved.

You have a few options for new commands:

* File >> Shell opens your default Unix shell, where you can type
commands interactively.

* File >> Default (or the name of any other Favorite from your
Session Preferences), will open that session.

* File >> Custom New Session... can also be used; simply ignore
the "Connect to Server..." button, and enter command line text.

* Hold down Option to see File >> Log-In Shell.  This invokes a
shell in log-in mode (with shell-dependent settings) that will
not inherit any environment variable settings from MacTelnet.

bq. Most session creation commands are also available
from the MacTelnet icon's Dock menu.
