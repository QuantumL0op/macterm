h2(#servers). Remote Sessions: Connecting to Servers

Select File >> Custom New Session... to begin.

bq. Only your first sessions should require this
customization step.  In the future, it will be faster
to rely on a Favorite or a saved session file to hold
your preferences.  A Favorite can be opened directly
from the File menu; for others, use File >> Open.

A Custom New Session opens a terminal window and a sheet to allow
configuration.

If you need special terminal settings that are saved as a
Favorite, you can choose to enable them now with the Terminal
menu.  Or, defer settings until after the session starts.  (Some
settings cannot be changed later.)

Your remote application will be accessible using a certain
protocol - ask your administrator if none of the options (**SSH**
1 or 2, **TELNET**, **SFTP** or **FTP**) seems appropriate.

There will be a "server" for your remote application, uniquely
identified by a combination of **host** and **port**.  In the
Host field, you can enter a name (like "apple.com") if one is
applicable; if you have only an address (like "123.45.67.123"),
enter that instead.  The Look Up button can be used to check if a
server name is valid (if so, it is transformed into a numeric
address; otherwise, it is unchanged).

bq. MacTelnet supports IP version 6 addresses too, so
you could also enter something like
"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:9d16:0164".

The Port field may not require changing...it is set automatically
when you choose a Protocol.  But some servers use a custom port
number, so adjust the value if necessary.

The User ID is what the server uses to identify you.  If not
provided, the name of your local Home folder is used (one-word,
all-lowercase).  Note that if a password is also required to
access the server, you will be prompted for that at connection
time; you cannot enter it initially in the configuration sheet.

bq. You'll notice that your changes set up a Unix
command line.  This is because MacTelnet relies on
Apple's installed commands to connect to your server.
Advanced users may wish to add extra options here; see
the Unix manual pages for each command to learn what is
available.

h2(#unix). Local Sessions: Running Unix Commands

As with remote applications, File >> Open... can be used to run a
command that you previously saved.

You have a few options for new commands:

* File >> Shell opens your default Unix shell, where you can type
commands interactively.

* File >> Default (or the name of any other Favorite from your
Session Preferences), will open that session.

* File >> Custom New Session... can also be used; simply ignore
the Remote Sessions Only section, and enter command line text at
the bottom of the dialog.

* Hold down Option to see File >> Log-In Shell.  This invokes a
shell in log-in mode (with shell-dependent settings) that will
not inherit any environment variable settings from MacTelnet.

bq. Most session creation commands are also available
from the MacTelnet icon's Dock menu.
