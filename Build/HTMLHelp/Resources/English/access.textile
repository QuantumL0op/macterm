h2(#servers). Remote Sessions: Connecting to Servers

Select "Custom New Session..." from the File menu to begin.

bq. Only your first sessions should require this customization step.
In the future, it will be faster to rely on a Favorite or a saved
session file to hold your preferences.  A Favorite can be opened
directly from the File menu, and saved sessions can be opened
by using the "Open Workspace..." command.

A Custom New Session opens a terminal window and a sheet to allow
configuration.

If your application requires custom terminal settings and you have
saved those as a Favorite, you can choose to enable them now with the
Terminal menu; otherwise, simply leave it as Default.

Your remote application will be accessible using a certain protocol -
ask your administrator if none of the options (**SSH** versions 1 or 2,
**TELNET**, **SFTP** or **FTP**) seems appropriate.

There will be a "server" for your remote application, uniquely identified
by a combination of **host** and **port**.  In the Host field, you can enter
a name (like "apple.com") if one is applicable; if you have only an
address (like "123.45.67.123"), enter that instead.  The Look Up button
can be used to check if a server name is valid (if so, it is transformed
into a numeric address; otherwise, it is unchanged).

bq. MacTelnet supports IP version 6 addresses as well, so you
could even use a new-style address like
"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:9d16:0164".

The Port field may not require changing...it was set automatically when
you chose a Protocol earlier.  But some servers use a custom port number,
so adjust the value if necessary.

The User ID is what the server uses to identify you.  If not provided,
the name of your Mac OS X Home folder is used (one-word, all-lowercase
name).  Note that if a password is also required to access the server,
you will be prompted for that at connection time; you cannot enter it
initially in the configuration sheet.

bq. You'll notice that your changes set up a Unix command line.
This is because MacTelnet relies on Apple's installed commands
to establish your server connection.  Advanced users may wish
to add extra options here.  See the Unix manual pages for
each command to learn the available options.

h2(#unix). Local Sessions: Running Unix Commands

Select "Default" from the File menu to open a window running your
default Unix shell.  Any commands you type here interact with
that shell, providing full access to that shell's capabilities.

bq. Note that the Preferences window can be used to change what
any Favorite does, including Default!  Your Default will not
open a new shell if you have modified Default to run something
else.

Another option is to select "Log-In Shell" from the File menu,
which will prompt you for your Mac OS X user ID and password before
presenting you with a shell.  The shell is also configured with some
extra log-in-only settings that are shell-dependent.

Yet another option is to use "Custom New Session...", ignoring the
Remote Sessions section and replacing the command line at the bottom
with a completely arbitrary Unix command.

As with remote applications, "Open Workspace..." can be used to run a
command that you previously saved.
