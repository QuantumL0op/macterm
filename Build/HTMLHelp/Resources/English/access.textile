h2(#servers). Remote Sessions: Connecting to Servers

Select File >> Custom New Session... to begin.

bq. Only your first sessions should require this
customization step.  In the future, it will be
faster to rely on a Favorite or a saved session
file to hold your preferences.  A Favorite can be
opened directly from the File menu; for others,
use File >> Open.

A Custom New Session opens a terminal window and a sheet to allow
configuration.

If your application requires custom terminal settings and you have
saved those as a Favorite, you can choose to enable them now with the
Terminal menu; otherwise, simply leave it as Default.

Your remote application will be accessible using a certain protocol -
ask your administrator if none of the options (**SSH** versions 1 or 2,
**TELNET**, **SFTP** or **FTP**) seems appropriate.

There will be a "server" for your remote application, uniquely identified
by a combination of **host** and **port**.  In the Host field, you can enter
a name (like "apple.com") if one is applicable; if you have only an
address (like "123.45.67.123"), enter that instead.  The Look Up button
can be used to check if a server name is valid (if so, it is transformed
into a numeric address; otherwise, it is unchanged).

bq. MacTelnet supports IP version 6 addresses too,
so you could also enter something like
"0000:0000:0000:0000:0000:ffff:9d16:0164".

The Port field may not require changing...it was set automatically
when you chose a Protocol earlier.  But some servers use a custom
port number, so adjust the value if necessary.

The User ID is what the server uses to identify you.  If not provided,
the name of your local Home folder is used (one-word, all-lowercase
name).  Note that if a password is also required to access the server,
you will be prompted for that at connection time; you cannot enter it
initially in the configuration sheet.

bq. You'll notice that your changes set up a Unix
command line.  This is because MacTelnet relies
on Apple's installed commands to connect to
your server.  Advanced users may wish to add
extra options here; see the Unix manual pages
for each command to learn what is available.

h2(#unix). Local Sessions: Running Unix Commands

Select File >> Default to open a window running your default Unix
shell.  Any commands you type here interact with that shell,
providing full access to that shell's capabilities.

bq. Note that the Preferences window can be used
to change what any Favorite does, including
Default!  Your Default will not open a new shell
if you have modified it to run something else.

Another option is to select File >> Log-In Shell, which will prompt
you for your Mac OS X user ID and password before presenting you
with a shell.  The shell is also configured with some extra
log-in-only settings that are shell-dependent.

Yet another option is to use File >> Custom New Session..., ignoring
the Remote Sessions section and replacing the command line at the
bottom with a completely arbitrary Unix command.

As with remote applications, File >> Open... can be used to run a
command that you previously saved.
