h1(pagetitle). Preferences

<div class="content">

This page is arranged in the same categories as those in the
MacTelnet Preferences window.  To access any of the settings
mentioned here, start by choosing the "Preferences..." item in
the MacTelnet menu.

h2(#general). General

h3(#generaloptions). Options

h4. Menus and Windows

h5(#simplify). Simplified user interface

Hides commands and portions of windows that are not frequently
needed.

h5(#noautoclose). Don't automatically close windows

Prevents a window from closing when the process running inside it
has quit.

h5(#noautonew). Don't create new windows automatically

Prevents a new shell from being created if MacTelnet is activated
while it has no windows open.

h4. Text

h5(#invert). Invert selected text

Uses high contrast colors for text selections instead of trying
to create a blend with the current window color scheme.

h5(#autocopy). Automatically Copy selected text

Whenever new text is highlighted, it is copied to the Clipboard.
This is how Unix-like systems behave, and may be how you are
accustomed to working with terminal-based applications.

h5(#dropmove). Move cursor to text drop location

Sends a series of arrow key sequences when you drop text on a
terminal, that instruct the application to put the cursor where
you dropped the text.  As long as you are using an application in
the terminal that understands this kind of sequence, you will see
Mac-like drag and drop behavior added!  This is very cool in a
terminal-based text editor or E-mail client, for instance.

When this feature is enabled, MacTelnet displays a ghost cursor
during drags to help you see exactly what the new cursor location
will be.

h5(#nodim). Don't dim background terminal text

To help emphasize the active terminal, MacTelnet alters the color
hues of background windows.  Use this option to quell recoloring.

h4. Keyboard

h5(#menukeys). Menu item key equivalents

Certain terminal applications may benefit from stricter control
over your keyboard; you can turn off even rudimentary menu item
key recognition if it helps avoid confusing applications in your
terminals.

h5(#mapbackquote). Map backquote key to escape character

On many keyboards, the backquote key is in a location similar to
or identical to the location of the Esc key on other keyboards.
Some users may wish to treat backquote keypresses as if they were
escape keypresses for this reason, especially if using something
that relies heavily on Esc such as the "vi" text editor.

Note, however, that Unix shells and other applications may
require use of a backquote.

h3(#generalspecial). Special

h4(#cursorflash). Terminal Cursor: Flashing

The cursor blinks on and off periodically when Flashing is set,
which may make it easier to see.  But, see also the Find Cursor
command in the Edit menu, which locates the cursor on demand.

h4(#cursorshape). Terminal Cursor: Shape

MacTelnet allows one of 5 different shapes for the terminal
cursor; a solid square is typical, but you may wish to have the
standard Mac vertical bar, a horizontal underline, or thicker
versions of either (more noticeable on LCD displays).

h4(#stackorigin). Window Stacking Origin

You can specify the location on the screen where the first
MacTelnet window is placed.  Subsequent windows automatically
stack diagonally.  Note that if you save a session or an entire
workspace, window locations are preserved and ignore this origin.

h4(#spacesfortab). Window Resize Effect

When window resizes affect terminal screen size, MacTelnet
dynamically calculates the maximum number of rows and columns
that can fit in the current window size (at current font size).

When window resizes affect text size, MacTelnet dynamically
calculates the maximum font size that can be used (in the current
terminal font) to fit the current number of rows and columns in
the current window size.

You can hold down the Option key prior to starting a window
resize to temporarily switch this preference.

h4(#spacesfortab). Copy Using Tabs For Spaces: Spaces Per Tab

When copying text with Copy Using Tabs For Spaces, this number
determines how many consecutive spaces are replaced with a single
tab character in the clipboard version.

h4(#commandN). Command-N Key Equivalent

MacTelnet has several ways to create sessions, and you may wish
to use one of them more than others.  You can map command-N as a
short-cut to whichever one you use most.

h3(#generalnotification). Notification

h4. Terminal Bell

h5. Sound

When a terminal audio event occurs, you can have MacTelnet play
the standard system beep (set up in System Preferences under
Sound).  Or, you can select any other sound file.  Finally, you
can turn off sound completely (note that this can be done for any
individual terminal using "Disable Bell" in the Terminal menu).

h5(#visualbell). Always use visual bell

If a terminal window is not active, any bell events from the
window (regardless of sound settings) will include a visual flash
to show you which window the bell came from.

However, you can choose to enable visuals all the time, in which
case even active terminals will flash when bells occur.

h5(#marginbell). Margin bell

Not implemented.  But it will eventually, if enabled, generate a
terminal bell event if you are typing and the cursor passes into
the last 5 columns of the display.

h5(#notifybeeps). Background notification on bell

If MacTelnet is not the active application, you can ask that you
receive special notification from the OS when one of your
terminals generates a bell.

h4(#notifymethod). Background Notification

For Notify of Terminal Beeps, as well as any other alert that may
show up when you are in another application (such as an error
message), you can specify how "annoying" MacTelnet may be.  The
options range from no interruptions at all, to an immediate alert
in your other application telling you that MacTelnet needs your
attention.

h2(#sessions). Sessions

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Sessions, a drawer appears showing all the
collections you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the
drawer and then edit settings in the main Preferences window for
that collection.

Sessions define how MacTelnet accesses a resource (a local or
remote terminal application), as well as other settings like key
mappings and the TEK graphics mode.  These are a little like
Bookmarks from your web browser, in that they allow you to easily
return to the things you use frequently.

h2(#macros). Macros

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Macros, a drawer appears showing all the macro
sets you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the drawer
and then edit settings in the main Preferences window for that
macro set.

All macro sets use the same key equivalents, so only one set can
be available at a time.  When a terminal window is active, use
the Keys menu to choose the current macro set.

h3. Invoke With

Currently, MacTelnet offers two ways to invoke macros: either
using a combination of the command (cloverleaf) key and keypad
keys such as numbers, or using the first twelve function keys at
the top of your keyboard.

h2(#terminals). Terminals

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Terminals, a drawer appears showing all the
collections you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the
drawer and then edit settings in the main Preferences window for
that collection.

Terminals decide somewhat technical aspects of a window, such as
the emulation type.  Usually, you set up one or more of these
with the help of an administrator or the documentation for your
terminal application, so that MacTelnet behaves correctly when
you access that terminal application.  When you create a custom
or Favorite session, you can associate a Terminal Favorite with
it, ensuring these important settings are always made for you.

h2(#formats). Formats

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Formats, a drawer appears showing all the formats
you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the drawer and
then edit settings in the main Preferences window for that
format.

Formats are collects of fonts, font sizes, colors, and more, that
decide how your terminal windows look.  You can use the View menu
to quickly change a window's format to one of the Favorites you
specify in Preferences, or to make customizations local to the
frontmost window.

h2(#macros). Full Screen

Settings that control "kiosk mode", the Full Screen command in
the View menu.  You can use these preferences to create a more
complete kiosk (by hiding the Dock, for example).

h2(#scripts). Scripts

This panel provides easy access to your Scripts Menu Items and
will make more scripting options available in the future.
