p(#abstract). This page is arranged in the same categories as those in
 the MacTerm Preferences window.  To access any of the settings
 mentioned here, start by choosing the "Preferences..." item in
 the MacTerm menu.  See also the "low-level settings":advprefs.html page.

h2(#collections). About Grouped Preferences

When you select the Macros, Workspaces, Sessions, Terminals,
 Formats or Translations categories, a special list of collections
 appears.  This means you may create *groups of preferences*.  The
 list is unique for every category.

h3. "Default" Item

Every list starts with a Default item.  If you do not want to
 create other groups, you can just edit the Default.  Keep in
 mind though that the Default is implicitly inherited by all
 other collections for settings that are not made explicitly in
 those collections.  The Default items also have special meanings
 for each category:

* The Default under "Macros" determines the set of macros that is first enabled in the Macros menu for any session that does not specify its own macro set (such as log-in shells).

* The Default under "Workspaces" determines what sessions spawn when MacTerm starts.  (You can use this to spawn several windows automatically if you wish.  You can also choose to disable all window slots in the Default Workspace so that no windows are spawned at startup time.)

* The Default under "Sessions" is always listed first in the File menu and there is an option to map it to a key equivalent.

* The Default under "Terminals" is used in any session that does not specify its own terminal (such as a log-in shell).

* The Default under "Formats" is used in any session that does not specify its own format (such as a log-in shell).

* The Default under "Translations" is used in any session that does not specify its own translation (such as a log-in shell).

h3. "+" Menu Button

This menu provides commands for creating new collections:

h4. New Collection

Adds a new item to the list.

h4. Import from File...

Use this to create a new collection based on settings that were
 exported to a file previously.  This can be something that was
 created by you (see "Export to File...", below), something that
 was given to you by someone else, or even something that you
 downloaded from MacTerm's web site.

The new collection will try to use any name that was given in
 the file.  If the name is already in use then the collection
 will appear under a different name.

h3. "-" Button

First select an item in the list and then use this button to
 remove the item.  (NOTE: So far in the beta there is a known
 bug where items may not disappear the first time you attempt to
 delete them.  It is possible you may have to click "-" several
 times before an item is actually removed from the list.  This
 bug will obviously be fixed before MacTerm is completed.)

h3. Up-Arrow Button

First select an item in the list and then use this button to move
 the item higher in the list.  You can use this repeatedly to
 move the item further.  Note that "Default" is always the first
 item and nothing can be moved above it.

h3. Down-Arrow Button

First select an item in the list and then use this button to move
 the item lower in the list.  You can use this repeatedly to
 move the item further.  Note that "Default" is always the first
 item and it cannot be moved down.

h3. Gear Menu Button

This is a contextual menu that provides additional commands for
 acting on whatever item in the list is selected:

h4. Duplicate Collection

Makes a copy of the selected collection of preferences and
 also creates a field for renaming the new collection.  Note
 that only defined settings are copied; anything that was being
 inherited by the original (from Default) continues to be
 inherited in the copy.

h4. Rename Collection

Creates an editable field around the name of the item so that
 you can call it something else.  Note that "Default" cannot be
 renamed.  *The Return key is a short-cut for this action.*

h4. Export to File...

Use this to create a property list file containing all of the
 settings directly defined in the selected collection.  Settings
 that were never directly set for the collection will NOT be
 exported (if they are imported later, they will implicitly
 inherit whatever the Default settings are at that time).

Exported settings are a good way to share among users of MacTerm.
 For instance, if you are the administrator of a school you might
 want to export some settings and make them available to students
 so that everyone's computer can be configured fairly easily.

h2(#general). General

h3(#generaloptions). Options

h4. Terminal Windows

h5(#noautoclose). No window close on process exit

Prevents a window from closing when the process running inside it
 has quit.  This only applies to processes that quit on their own;
 if you choose to close a window yourself, it will not stay open.

When a window has terminated and remains open, the special menu
 command File >> Restart Session becomes available.

h5(#noautonew). No automatic new windows

Prevents a new session from being created at startup, or when the
 application is activated and no windows are open.

Note that the type of session created will implicitly match the
 "Command-N Key Equivalent" preference.

h5(#fadebkgnd). Fade in background

Causes terminal windows to become translucent when MacTerm is not
 the active application.

Low-level preferences can be used to further customize this mode.

h4. Text

h5(#invert). Invert selected text

Uses high contrast colors for text selections instead of trying
 to create a blend with the current window color scheme.

h5(#autocopy). Automatically Copy selected text

Whenever new text is highlighted, it is copied to the Clipboard.
 This is how Unix-like systems behave, and may be how you are
 accustomed to working with terminal-based applications.

h5(#dropmove). Move cursor to text drop location

Displays a ghost terminal cursor during drags, and sends a series
 of arrow key sequences to move the cursor when the drag ends.

When terminal applications properly respond to the sequences, the
 result is effectively to give them Mac-like drag-and-drop!

However, not all terminal applications properly respond to arrow
 key sequences.  The typical error is to display various "garbage"
 characters instead of moving the cursor.

h5(#nodim). Don't dim background terminal text

To help emphasize the active terminal, MacTerm alters the color
 hues of background windows.  Use this option to quell recoloring.

h5(#nodim). Don't warn about multi-line Paste

Immediately dumps text into a terminal on Paste, instead of
 displaying a "Join" option when the text spans multiple lines.

Note that even if the warning appears, a "Paste Normally" option
 is always provided.

A number of programs, like Unix shells, will perform actions when
 they see new-line characters.  If you use these kinds of programs
 frequently in a session, then disabling the Paste warning is not
 recommended.

h4. Keyboard

h5(#mapbackquote). Treat backquote key like Escape

On many keyboards, the backquote key is in a location similar to
 or identical to the location of the Esc key on other keyboards.
 Some users may wish to treat backquote keypresses as if they were
 escape keypresses for this reason, especially if using something
 that relies heavily on Esc such as the "vi" text editor.

Note, however, that Unix shells and other applications may
 require use of a backquote.

h5(#focusfollowsmouse). Focus follows mouse

Allows you to type into any terminal without bringing its window
 to the front; you simply point at the terminal with the mouse
 before typing.  This is the way many window managers behave on
 Unix-like systems.

h3(#generalspecial). Special

h4. Terminal Cursor

h5(#cursorshape). Shape

MacTerm allows one of 5 different shapes for the terminal
 cursor; a solid square is typical, but you may wish to have the
 standard Mac vertical bar, a horizontal underline, or thicker
 versions of either (more noticeable on LCD displays).

h5(#cursorflash). Flash

The cursor blinks on and off periodically when Flash is set,
 which may make it easier to see.  But, see also the Find Cursor
 command in the Edit menu, which locates the cursor on demand.

h4(#stackorigin). Window Stacking Origin

You can specify the location (on any display) where a new window
 is placed.  Subsequent windows automatically stack diagonally.

Note that windows restored as part of a Workspace (File menu)
 will give precedence to any boundaries that might be saved with
 the Workspace.

h4(#spacesfortab). Window Resize Effect

The Window Resize Effect determines how terminal windows are
 altered when resized explicitly with the mouse, or implicitly
 when entering Full Screen mode.

When window resizes affect terminal screen size, MacTerm
 dynamically calculates the maximum number of rows and columns
 that can fit in the current window size (at current font size).

When window resizes affect text size, MacTerm dynamically
 calculates the maximum font size that can be used (in the current
 terminal font) to fit the current number of rows and columns in
 the current window size.

You can hold down the Control key prior to starting a window resize
 to temporarily switch this preference for that resize only.  The
 Option key can be held down to have the same effect when you use
 the "Enter Full Screen" command.

h4(#spacesfortab). Copy With Tab Substitution

When copying text using Copy with Tab Substitution, this number
 determines how many consecutive spaces are replaced with a single
 tab character before putting the text on the clipboard.

h4(#commandN). Command-N Key Equivalent

MacTerm has several ways to create sessions, and you may wish
 to use one of them more than others.  You can map command-N as a
 short-cut to whichever one you use most.

Note that this previously would also determine the window that
 opens automatically at startup.  But, the startup window(s) now
 come from the Default Workspace collection.

h3(#generalnotification). Notification

h4. Terminal Bell

h5. Sound

When a terminal audio event occurs, you can have MacTerm ignore
 it, or play the standard system beep, or any other library sound.

The set of sounds in the menu is defined the first time the
 Preferences window opens, based on the contents of any Sounds
 folders found in /System/Library, /Library, or the Library folder
 of your Home folder.

Note that sound can also be controlled in individual terminals by
 using the "Bell" command in the Terminal menu (or the
 corresponding toolbar item).

h5(#visualbell). Always use visual bell

If a terminal window is not active, any bell events from the
 window (regardless of sound settings) will include a visual flash
 to show you which window the bell came from.

However, you can choose to enable visuals all the time, in which
 case even active terminals will flash when bells occur.

h5(#notifybeeps). Background notification on bell

If MacTerm is not the active application, you can ask that you
 receive special notification from the OS when one of your
 terminals generates a bell.

h4(#notifymethod). Background Notification

For "Background notification on bell", as well as any other alert
 that may show up when you are in another application (such as an
 error message), you can specify how "annoying" MacTerm may be.
 The options range from no interruptions at all, to an immediate
 alert in your other application telling you that MacTerm needs
 your attention.

h2(#macros). Macros

bq. You can create more than one set of preferences in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a drawer
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the drawer, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main Preferences
 window.

bq. Each set in this category has an additional list
 of items.  First choose a set from the drawer, then
 choose an item from the numbered list, before editing.
 You can also edit the names of the numbered items, as
 you would for any item in the Finder.

Macro sets are completely arbitrary actions that you can bind
 to almost any key combinations you wish!

Only macros from the active set, if any, are enabled, and these
 are shown in the Macros menu along with their key equivalents.
 The active set can also be changed using the Macros menu.

If the "None" set is chosen, all macros are disabled.  Otherwise,
 the macros in the active set can be used by typing a key
 equivalent (the macro's main key, plus some optional combination
 of modifiers) or by selecting its name from the Macros menu.

h3. Macro List

This displays the number of macros in the set (currently fixed
 at 12), and their names.

The names can be edited by clicking and hovering on them, or
 selecting an item and pressing Return.  Names are currently
 only used in the Macros menu (if enabled).

h3. Selected Macro

To edit a macro, select it from the list and then modify its
 fields in this section.  Changes take effect immediately (so,
 you could test in a terminal window at the same time, provided
 you made this the current macro set via the Map menu).

h4. Invoke With

The key or combination of keys that will trigger the macro
 action.

If "Ordinary Key" is selected, you should type one character
 into the field next to the pop-up menu to indicate which key.
 For example, "K" indicates that typing the K key will activate
 the macro.

Alternately, you can choose from a number of "special" keys
 in the menu.

No matter which keys you choose, you have to be mindful of
 what may already be in use by MacTerm, your computer's
 defaults, or the application you're going to run in the
 terminal.  In general, it's not a good idea to choose very
 simple key combinations.

**Important:** If you use the Macros menu to select the set you
 are editing, it is easy to see how your key equivalent will be
 interpreted by Mac OS X.  Certain combinations are "special"
 and will not be available to you.

h4. Modifiers

Any combination of zero to four standard modifier keys that
 must be held down _in addition_ to the "Invoke With" key,
 before the macro will be activated.

Modifiers are highly recommended!  Most keys are needed for
 other things by default, and shouldn't invoke macros by
 themselves.

h4. Action

The type of behavior the macro will trigger, and the way the
 Contents will be interpreted:

h5. Open URL

The Contents are interpreted as a URL and opened locally with
 whatever helper application is appropriate (such as your
 preferred web browser).

h5. New Window with Command

The Contents are interpreted as a command line, split into
 words (on whitespace) and run in a new terminal window.
 When the command finishes, the terminal window is closed.

Note that you can overcome limitations of this command line
 by running your command in a shell, or providing the path to
 a script (written in any language) that does more elaborate
 things.

h5. Enter Text Verbatim

The Contents will be typed into the active terminal view as if
 the keyboard was used, and *no* special sequences will be
 substituted.

h5. Enter Text with Substitutions

The Contents will be typed into the active terminal view as if
 the keyboard was used; however, any special sequences will
 first be substituted with their current values.

This mode is very useful if your macro contains things like
 escape sequences or other "invisible" characters (which is
 common when "emulating key codes":keys.html from other
 operating systems, for example).

Many substitution sequences correspond directly to the codes
 used by control keys.  For this reason, MacTerm offers an
 "Insert Control Key Character..." button that helps you type
 the correct sequences with a single click.  For example, the
 control-D character is equivalent to "\004", and when the
 palette is opened you can simply click the "^D" button to
 insert a "\004" sequence.

Note that macros with substitutions can fail if your macro
 has errors.  You can use the Console application to see errors
 that MacTerm generated for your macro.

The possible substitutions are:

table(deftable).
(def). |_<(key). Code|_<(desc). Meaning|
(def). |<(key). @\\@|(desc)<. backslash (@\@)|
(def). |<(key). @\t@|(desc)<. horizontal tab|
(def). |<(key). @\r@|(desc)<. carriage return|
(def). |<(key). @\n@|(desc)<. line feed|
(def). |<(key). @\e@|(desc)<. escape (@^[@)|
(def). |<(key). @\0nn@|(desc)<. arbitrary ASCII in octal[1]; e.g. @\004@ is @^D@|
(def). |<(key). @\1nn@|(desc)<. arbitrary ASCII in octal[1]; e.g. @\177@ is delete|
(def). |<(key). @\i@|(desc)<. dynamically substitute an IP address[2] of the computer|
(def). |<(key). @\#@|(desc)<. dynamically substitute the number of terminal lines|
(def). |<(key). @\"@|(desc)<. quote; allowed for legacy reasons, but no longer needs escaping|

fn1. To see the octal versions of all ASCII characters,
 look at <a href="x-man-page://ascii">x-man-page://ascii</a> (opens a
 MacTerm window and runs "man ascii").  Also note that the button
 "Insert Control Key Character..." can be used to help insert the
 right code for a variety of keys.

fn2. Currently, there is no way to choose which IP address is actually
 sent with "\i".  But you can use Window >> Show IP Addresses to
 see all the IP addresses that your computer has, and drag the
 desired one into a terminal window.

h2(#workspaces). Workspaces

bq. You can create more than one set of preferences in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a drawer
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the drawer, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main Preferences
 window.

Workspaces manage multiple terminal windows on one or more
 displays.  In addition, the Default is used at startup time to
 automatically spawn zero or more windows for you.

h3. Window List

This displays the number of windows that can be in the workspace
 (currently fixed at 10), and their names.

The names can be edited by clicking and hovering on them, or
 selecting an item and pressing Return.  Names are used to title
 the new windows that are created; leave them empty to have a
 name chosen automatically.

h3. Selected Window

To edit a window, select it from the list and then modify its
 fields in this section.  Changes take effect immediately (so,
 you could use the File menu to spawn your modified workspace).

h4. Session

The session that is started in this window.

If "None (No Window)" is selected, no window is opened at all,
 and other window-specific settings are ignored.

h4. Boundaries

This specifies where the window appears.  It can be on any
 display.

If "Use tabs to arrange windows" is set for the Workspace, then
 all of the windows in the Workspace are initially glued
 together, and the only boundaries that matter are those of the
 first window in the Workspace.  (Windows are created in the
 order they are listed in the Workspace.)

See also the "Window Stacking Origin", which applies to any new
 window that is not created as part of a Workspace.

h3. Settings

h4(#usetabs). Use tabs to arrange windows

Once enabled, all new windows (but not existing ones) will be
 given tab adornments and will stick together automatically.

New windows are added to the tab group of the active window.
 A tab can be moved to a new group by clicking the up-arrow
 button on its tab, or using Window >> Move to New Workspace.

**Tip:** If you're using more than one display, or Spaces, it
 is handy to have a tab group for each space.

It is important to notice that MacTerm tabs are normal
 windows, so they are independent and can be modified in the
 usual ways.  The _only_ exception is that all the windows in
 the group will move together.

If a sheet is open on one tab, you can still reach other tabs
 by clicking on them with the mouse.

You can also drag and drop between tabs: simply move the mouse
 over a tab to activate its window.

h2(#sessions). Sessions

bq. You can create more than one set of preferences in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a drawer
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the drawer, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main Preferences
 window.

Sessions are a little like Bookmarks from your web browser.

These collections specify how to access a resource (typically a
 local or remote terminal application).  They are also used to
 define key mappings, set up vector graphics, and precisely
 control data transfers.

Note that MacTerm can also save session details to files with
 File >> Save As, though the files do not contain as many details
 as Preferences do.

h3(#sessionresource). Resource

h4. Command

A Resource is actually defined entirely by its command line field,
 but some helpers are available to make it easier to produce the
 kind of command that you need.

bq. Note that even if you use a helper (such as the "Shell" button)
 to initialize a command, you are still allowed to edit the
 command further.

The "Shell" button writes a command to invoke your default shell.
 For most users this is set by the version of Mac OS X that you
 have, but MacTerm will also respect any custom shell that was
 selected by the @chsh@ Unix utility.

The "Log-In Shell" button writes a command to invoke your shell,
 but in a more controlled way (for instance, Unix environment is
 not inherited).  In most shells this will also affect how the
 shell starts, so you may see slightly different behavior; for
 example, you may see a welcome message.

The "Remote Shell..." button opens the Servers panel.  Note that
 edits in the Servers panel overwrite the command line field!  To
 learn more about the Servers panel, review
 "its documentation":windows.html#serverbrowser.

It is important to note that MacTerm splits this line into
 words (on whitespace), and does not interpret *any* characters:
 not even those common to Unix shells like "~", "|" and ">".  If
 you want to run a more complex command, you can save it in a
 script for the target shell, and ask MacTerm to run the script.

h4. Terminal

Specifies the Terminals collection that will be used to set up
 the emulator for the session terminal window.  Most of the
 terminal settings can be changed while the session is running, by
 using the Terminal menu; and the set can be modified using the
 Preferences window.

In Unix sessions, you typically will set a "TERM" environment
 variable that is consistent with the Terminal setting.

h4. Format

Specifies the Formats collection that will be used to set up
 the fonts and colors for the session terminal window.  You can
 change font and color settings while the session is running, by
 using the View menu; and the set can be modified using the
 Preferences window.

h4. Translation

Specifies the Translations collection that will be used to
 interpret characters sent to the terminal; for instance, in
 order to display the right accents on letters for words in a
 particular language.  This can be changed while the session is
 running, by using the Map menu, and the set can be modified
 using the Preferences window.

In Unix sessions, you typically will set a "LANG" environment
 variable that is consistent with the Translation setting.

h3(#sessiondataflow). Data Flow

h4. Duplication

MacTerm can send keyboard characters directly to the terminal
 as it transmits them to a session (and also display any
 "non-printable" keystrokes as floating tags); this is known as
 local echo.

Local echoing is useful for slow connections to remote servers or
 devices, because it displays what you type immediately instead
 of waiting for the actual response.  (The floating Command Line
 in MacTerm gives a similar benefit; see the Window menu.)

Of course, this makes it possible to see every key twice: once
 when MacTerm shows it immediately, and again when the server
 finally responds.  You may be able to avoid this if the remote
 system provides a way to disable its echoing; though realize
 that the local echo is just an approximation of what the server
 response would be and it may not be exactly right.

Disable this setting most of the time, since fast processes will
 respond so quickly that there is no clear delay between hitting
 a key and seeing a result in the window.

Note that this can be set temporarily by using the menu command
 Terminal >> Local Echo.

h4. Line Insertion Delay

When you use Paste or drag-and-drop for multi-line text, the
 session may not be prepared to receive that much data at once;
 this can cause various problems for the running process.

MacTerm automatically splits these insertions into lines, and
 gives you the option of pausing for a short period of time in
 between each inserted line.  You can set the delay to zero for
 immediate insertion.

h4. Scrolling Speed

An artificial delay imposed on the emulator's data processing
 loop, to slow down the terminal.  This may help readability
 for fast-moving streams, or it may just be useful for
 emulating a user's slow connection to an application.

Note that there is also Terminal >> Suspend (Scroll Lock) and
 the associated key equivalents, to temporarily stop a command
 from displaying any more data.

h4. Capture to File

You can choose to automatically capture this session to a
 specific file when it starts.  Note also that this can be done
 from a menu, File >> Begin Capture to File.

Currently, MacTerm does not have sophisticated ways to handle
 automatic file captures.  It would be nice, for instance, if
 successive sessions could use new files in a target folder and
 not overwrite the same file.

h3(#sessioncontrolkeys). Keyboard

You can map certain key combinations to special behaviors that
 allow control over applications and data flow.

Usually the default mappings are sufficient, however there are
 notable Unix applications (like "pine" and "emacs") that may need
 to use the default control-key mappings for something else.

Note also that the Control Keys palette allows you to enter _any_
 control key at any time, regardless of key mappings.  See the
 Window menu.

h4. Process Control

h5. Interrupt Process

Defaults to control-C (^C), the key sequence that will cause the
 application in a terminal to quit immediately if possible.

This is also in the menu bar, Terminal >> Interrupt Process.

h4. Flow Control

h5. Suspend (Scroll Lock / XOFF)

Defaults to control-S (^S), the key sequence that will cause a
 scroll lock (also known as XOFF, or "suspend transmission", or
 sending a stop signal to a Unix process).

While suspended, no new text will appear in the terminal even
 though the session remains active.  This can be useful to pause
 rapidly-scrolling displays.

This is also in the menu bar, Terminal >> Suspend (Scroll Lock),
 and is available as a toolbar item.

h5. Resume (XON)

Defaults to control-Q (^Q), the key sequence that will cause a
 scroll unlock (also known as XON, or "resume transmission", or
 sending a start signal to a Unix process).

A Resume is like an Undo for a Suspend.

This is also in the menu bar, Terminal >> Suspend (Scroll Lock),
 and is available as a toolbar item.

h4. Emacs Cursor

The Emacs text editor has its own commands for moving the cursor
 in the buffer.  You can choose to have your Mac arrow keys
 trigger the appropriate Emacs commands; this includes the effects
 of using Option and Command on arrow keys to move by larger
 increments.  For instance, in Mac text editors, you can move to
 the next word with option-right-arrow; MacTerm will cause this
 sequence to send a "forward-word" Emacs command.

h4. Emacs Meta

The Emacs text editor relies heavily on a key that is not
 available on Mac keyboards, the meta key.  However, you can ask
 MacTerm to emulate the meta key by using other keys.

h4. Delete

Specifies what a Delete keypress on your Mac keyboard will do.
 Some remote applications do not understand the default
 interpretation of Delete and can respond in odd ways (such as
 printing a "^H").  Choose between either regular Delete, or a
 Backspace.

Note that you can temporarily choose the alternate mapping by
 using shift-Delete or command-Delete in a terminal window.

Note further that MacTerm's Macros are very flexible and could
 be configured to set your own custom mapping for Delete (or many
 other keys).

h4. New Line

Since some systems or applications recognize different characters
 for end-of-line, you can specify how MacTerm sends a new-line
 (say, when pressing Return or when pasting or dragging in text
 that spans multiple lines).  When source text such as a Paste
 contains new-line markers already, those markers are replaced
 with your chosen New Line mappings below.

"CR" means "carriage return" and sends one character: ASCII code 13.
 This is most likely to be useful when connecting to a remote
 system that is running the Classic Mac OS 9 or earlier.

"CR LF" means "carriage return, line feed" and sends two
 characters: ASCII codes 13 and 10.  This is most likely to be
 useful when connecting to a remote MS-DOS or Windows system.

"CR NULL" means "carriage return, null character" and sends two
 characters: ASCII codes 13 and 0.  This is most likely to be
 useful when interacting directly with remote servers over
 certain protocols.  It is also known to be helpful on systems
 running BSD version 4.3.

"LF" means "line feed" and sends one character: ASCII code 10.
 This is most likely to be useful on Unix systems.

h3(#sessiontek). Graphics (TEK)

MacTerm is not only a terminal emulator, but also a display for
 various kinds of images.  You can enable a vector graphics
 command set for a session so that, when MacTerm receives
 certain special sequences, it will automatically render the data
 as a picture instead of dumping it to the terminal screen.

h4. Command set

If you want to use vector graphics, select the command set that
 indicates the kind of graphics data the session will send.
 TEK 4105 is a more powerful protocol that support scrolling,
 colored lines, and rotated text compared to TEK 4014.

h4. PAGE clears screen

When a new vector graphics image is created (known in TEK as a
 PAGE command), it is normally put into its own window.  If you do
 not want several windows and instead want MacTerm to reuse the
 same window, enable the clear-screen option.

h2(#terminals). Terminals

bq. You can create more than one set of preferences in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a drawer
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the drawer, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main Preferences
 window.

Terminals decide somewhat technical aspects of a window, such as
 the emulation type.  Usually, you set up one or more of these
 with the help of an administrator or application documentation,
 so that MacTerm behaves correctly when you use an application
 in a terminal window.  Custom and collection Sessions can
 associate a Terminal collection with them, ensuring that these
 important settings are always made for you.

h3. Emulation

h4. Base Emulator

This selects which terminal emulator implementation in MacTerm
 will be used to interpret commands (encoded as special sequences
 in transmitted text).

h5. None ("Dumb")

A "dumb terminal" doesn't actually emulate anything, though it
 will make sure every character it receives is visible.  For
 example, the character with ASCII code 200 is printed as the
 string "<200>", and ASCII code 27 prints as "^[".  This is
 useful when communicating with certain kinds of servers, or
 when debugging commands.

Advanced users should note that MacTerm's Python interface
 lets you customize the "pretty printing" of the dumb terminal.

h5. VT100

This is an accurate emulation of Digital Equipment Corporation's
 VT100 terminal device, including its VT52 compatibility mode,
 terminal LEDs, and other less common features.

h5. VT102

Largely compatible with any system that wants a VT100, this
 device has additional capabilities like print streaming.
 MacTerm is a very good VT102 emulator.

h5. VT220

This device has additional capabilities like special keyboard
 keys and 8-bit controls.  MacTerm is a very good VT220
 emulator, but it does not currently support all features, like
 user-defined keys (UDKs) and certain character set registers.

Note that in the Window menu there are commands to show VT220
 floating key palettes.  You may also find it useful to set up
 Macros via Preferences for key sequences of your own; more
 guidance on this is available in the "Macros section":#macros.

h5. XTerm

Mostly a superset of VT emulators, the XTerm terminal type also
 refers to the behavior of the @xterm@ Unix terminal program.
 MacTerm supports certain standard sequences such as cursor
 movement, although mouse support is not yet implemented.  If
 you are using a highly complex terminal program, you may want
 to try both the VT220 and XTerm types to see which works best
 for now.  MacTerm's XTerm support has improved over time.

It is important to note that several XTerm features have been
 extracted into Emulation Tweaks (see below) so that they may be
 enabled while *any* terminal is active, even a base VT100.  It
 is therefore not enough to choose the XTerm base type, you must
 also enable all XTerm-related tweaks to see the most accurate
 possible results.

In addition, note that TEK vector graphics is a feature of XTerm
 that MacTerm enables separately; see "Graphics (TEK)":#sessiontek.
 You must enable TEK for a Session, it is not automatically
 handled just because you chose the XTerm type.

h4. Identity

A standard identifier for the terminal emulator's supported
 features (sometimes called an answer-back message).

Applications may rely on this to determine if they should even
 bother to send certain command sequences.  For instance, if
 you identify as "vt100", an application isn't likely to send
 commands that only a VT102 supports.

This name is suggested for you automatically when you choose
 a Base Emulator.  Note however that you may still need to
 change it depending on any Emulation Tweaks (below).

This should be reflected in the "TERM" environment variable
 on Unix-like systems, and MacTerm tries to set this for you
 when you start a local command.  For remote commands, such as
 a secure shell (SSH) session, you may have to fix this yourself!

h4. Emulation Tweaks

MacTerm allows you to customize some of the features of its
 emulators.  There are a couple of main reasons for this:

* Some applications rely on bugs in common emulators or the original devices, and won't work unless MacTerm is also buggy.

* Sometimes an environment assumes that popular features of advanced terminals are available (such as XTerm window titles) even though it is mostly dependent on a more basic terminal type like VT102.

Applications may ignore tweaks unless you also set the Identity
 to tell them that the feature is supported.  Each tweak below
 suggests an Identity that will enable it.

The tweaks currently allowed are:

h5. VT100

h6. Fix Line Wrapping Bug

Some applications have come to rely on text wrapping occurring
 in an idealized way, instead of how it actually is on a VT100
 device.  The typical symptom is a full-screen application that
 scrolls up one line instead of occupying the whole terminal
 gracefully.  A temporary work-around is to use the menu option
 Terminal >> Line Wrap.  This emulation tweak is not fully
 implemented.

h5. XTerm

Note that XTerm is also an emulator type of its own, that has
 additional cursor movement capabilities among other features.
 You may choose to enable or disable the following XTerm features
 whether or not you have chosen an actual XTerm as Base Emulator.

h6. 256 Colors

Enables all 256 new XTerm colors, which includes the 16 basic
 "ANSI colors" that can be customized in MacTerm's Formats
 preferences.  This allows an application to give text a specific
 foreground and background color, instead of relying on terminal
 defaults.

Note that this feature could significantly increase the memory
 requirements for a terminal.

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm-256color"
 or a 256-color variant such as "gnome-256color".

h6. Background Color Erase

In programs such as text editors that customize terminal colors,
 this mode allows the most recent custom color to be applied to
 any erased region (for efficiency, so that color settings do not
 have to be repeatedly transmitted).

This is a very important mode that is needed by many modern
 terminal-based programs, so it is enabled by default.

h6. Color

Enables *only* the 16 basic colors commonly called "ANSI colors",
 which can be customized in MacTerm's Formats preferences.
 This allows an application to give text a specific foreground
 and background color, instead of relying on terminal defaults.

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm-color" or
 equivalent.

h6. Graphics Characters

Enables a special set of graphics characters, such as lines and
 symbols.  Note that Terminal >> Reset Graphics Characters is a
 special "soft reset" that turns off only the character set, in
 case an application accidentally leaves your whole window in an
 unreadable state of rendering graphics!

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm" or
 equivalent.

h6. Window Alteration

Allows applications to change the title of your terminal window,
 as well as its minimized state, position, size, and other
 attributes.  This is not completely supported by MacTerm's
 daily builds yet, but it will be soon.

For this to work, your Identity may need to be "xterm" or
 equivalent.

h3. Screen

Screen settings determine how much text can be stored, how much
 is visible, and how quickly it can be augmented.

**Note:** These settings are under evaluation and may move to
 other preferences categories in the future.

h4. Width

The maximum number of columns of text (equivalent to characters,
 in Western locales, when in single-width) that are stored and
 visible on each line.  Currently, MacTerm won't horizontally
 scroll terminals, so this is also the display width.

If a window is reduced in size, it may internally retain the
 entire original line.  A line that is made double-size will
 only display half of its capacity.

h4. Height

The maximum number of _visible_ lines of text.  This refers to
 normal size only; double-size lines implicitly occupy two lines
 out of the buffer.

If a window is reduced in size, it may completely lose the
 contents of the bottom lines that were cut off.

h4. Scrollback

It is often useful to refer back to previous text written to a
 terminal, so there is an option to save it.  In addition, note
 that Terminal >> Delete Entire Scrollback Buffer can be used at
 any time during a session to wipe out the saved lines.

There are a few options available:

h5. Off

Does not save any lines, and therefore displays no scroll bar
 in the terminal.

h5. Fixed Size

Allocates no more than the given amount.  If measured in rows,
 each row might occupy as much memory as the maximum width
 requires, plus space for auxiliary data (Unicode characters,
 attributes, etc.).  If measured in kilobytes, divides the given
 buffer size by the requirements for each character of width, so
 that the buffer doesn't use any more memory.

h5. Unlimited

The scrollback size is dynamically allocated in progressively
 larger chunks to keep up with demand; it is never discarded.

h5. Distributed

The specified amount of space is globally shared across all
 other terminal windows that also have the Distributed setting,
 and they effectively share memory.  If a terminal hasn't been
 used in awhile, its oldest scrollback lines are recycled by
 the windows that actually are being used.

h3. Options

h4. General

h5. Wrap lines (no truncation)

If the cursor is at the end of a line and another character is
 written, this cause the cursor to automatically wrap to the
 beginning of the next line.  In addition, if this was the very
 bottom line, the content scrolls up one line.  (Certain
 terminal emulators may handle this slightly differently.)

If wrapping is disabled, the final character is simply
 obliterated each time a new character arrives, until an
 explicit new-line sequence is read or the cursor is relocated
 by the application.

This sets the default for Terminal >> Line Wrap.

h5. Do not strip high bit of bytes

Specifies that the data is 8 bits instead of 7 bits.  The
 MacTerm daily builds currently do not handle this setting
 reliably.

h5. Save lines when screen clears

If an application requests a full screen clear, this causes
 the entire content of the screen to first be copied into the
 scrollback buffer (as if it "scrolled off the top") before
 clearing the screen.

Otherwise, the screen is cleared and anything on it is lost.

This sets the default for Terminal >> Save Lines on Clear.

h4. Keyboard

h5. Normal keypad top row

Prevents the clear, =, /, and * keypad keys from being mapped
 respectively to the PF1, PF2, PF3 and PF4 keys of a VT220
 terminal.

h5. Local page keys

Prevents the home, end, page up and page down keys from sending
 commands to the application running in the terminal; instead,
 they affect the local terminal display.  Specifically, a local
 "home" scrolls to the very top, an "end" scrolls to the very
 bottom, a "page up" scrolls the content down by a screenful,
 and a "page down" scrolls the content upward by a screenful.

h2(#formats). Formats

bq. You can create more than one set of preferences in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a drawer
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the drawer, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main Preferences
 window.

bq. Preferences in this category allow inheritance;
 checking this box for a setting will erase the custom
 value for that setting.  When applied to a window, a
 collection with inherited settings will only overwrite
 the settings that are not inherited.  In new windows,
 inherited settings will match Default settings.

notextile. <a name="helpwithscreenformatting"></a><!-- must use this exact tag; see ExactMatch.kv -->

Formats are collections of fonts, font sizes, colors, and more,
 that decide how your terminal windows look.  You can use the View
 menu to change a window's format to one of the collections you
 specify in Preferences, or to make customizations local to the
 frontmost window.

h3. Normal

Settings that apply to all text, unless overridden by some more
 specific property.

To edit most settings, click on a box and the standard system
 panel (Fonts or Colors) will appear.

Character width is normally 100%, but you can choose to make the
 text cells of a terminal slightly narrower or wider (useful with
 certain fonts).  It is important to realize that if the width is
 not 100%, the renderer may have to use less optimal methods of
 placing text, which could make text scrolling noticeably slower.

Color settings have two entries, the leftmost box is the text
 (foreground) color and the rightmost box is the background color.

h3. ANSI Colors

Terminal applications can rely on an ANSI standard palette of
 colors.  While it is a good idea to choose colors that match the
 specified names, sometimes you have to change them so they don't
 clash with your other customizations!

Color settings have two entries, the leftmost box is the "normal"
 version and the rightmost box is the "bold" (or emphasized) one.
 Ordinarily, the bold color is a slightly brighter version of the
 normal color.

Feel free to experiment, "Set to the Standard Colors..." can be
 clicked to restore the 16 ordinary colors.

Not all applications in terminals will make use of these colors.
 In addition, a Terminal collection can disable them.

h2(#translations). Translations

bq. You can create more than one set of preferences in
 this category.  When you select the icon, a drawer
 appears with all the collections you have.  Simply
 choose a name from the list in the drawer, and then
 edit that collection's settings in the main Preferences
 window.

A translation table essentially allows the terminal to display
 text the way it is supposed to, according to what an application
 in a terminal expects.

The Map menu allows you to choose among these translation
 settings while sessions are running.

h3. Settings

h4. Character Set

Choose an encoding from the list to tell MacTerm how to
 interpret text while these translation settings are active.
 Typically a good value is "Unicode (UTF-8)".

h4. Options

h5. Use a backup font

Unfortunately, not all fonts are the same: some of them cannot
 render all possible characters.  A "backup font" allows you to
 *prefer* current Format preferences for most text (perhaps
 because those fonts look nicer in general), but use the backup
 to handle special characters.  A Unicode font is recommended as
 a backup font.

h2(#fullscreen). Full Screen

Settings that control "kiosk mode", the Full Screen command in
 the MacTerm application menu.  You can use these preferences to
 create a more complete kiosk (by hiding the menu bar, for
 example).

Note also the General preference (above) for removing all menu
 command keys, which can also be useful for kiosks.

A Full Screen terminal window will implicitly obey your setting
 for "Window Resize Effect" (in General); that is, it will either
 cause the screen dimensions to stay the same and increase the
 font size, or it will keep the font size the same and increase
 the number of columns and/or rows of the terminal screen.  You
 can temporarily invert this setting by holding down the Option
 key while entering Full Screen mode.

h3. Options

h4. Access Control

h5. Show menu bar on demand

The menu bar is hidden in Full Screen mode, but it can normally
 be displayed simply by moving the mouse to the top of the screen
 and pausing a moment.

If you want the menu bar to be completely unusable, disable this
 option and also disable the "Menu key equivalents" option in the
 General category.

h5. Show scroll bar

If your goal is to run an application in the terminal window for
 visitors of a kiosk, it may be appropriate to hide the scroll bar
 so that none of the "junk" normally cached in the scrollback is
 accessible.

h5. Show window frame

If unset, the content region of a terminal window fills its whole
 display, leaving no room for the window title or toolbar (though
 the colored matte space is still present, and there is space for
 a scroll bar).

h5. Allow "Force Quit" command

To make kiosks harder to mess with, you can prevent the user from
 accessing the system Force Quit function.

Note that this offers "pretty good" security, but does not guard
 against all possible ways that MacTerm could be interrupted.
 For example, a background application could pop up, MacTerm
 could crash, or the user may be able to command-Tab to some other
 program.

h4. Effects

h5. Superfluous graphical effects

In full screen mode, MacTerm has significantly more screen
 resolution and therefore has more options for rendering terminals
 in interesting ways!  If you do not want kiosks to look much
 different from normal terminal windows, disable this option.

h4. Deactivation

h5. Display an "off switch" window

If you do not want your kiosk disturbed, you may wish to remove
 the floating button that appears by default.  (Full Screen can
 always be disabled, but without this button it is less likely
 that visitors will determine how.)
