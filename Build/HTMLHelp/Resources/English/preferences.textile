h1(pagetitle). Preferences

<div class="content">

This page is arranged in the same categories as those in the
MacTelnet Preferences window.  To access any of the settings
mentioned here, start by choosing the "Preferences..." item in
the MacTelnet menu.

h2(#general). General

h3(#generaloptions). Options

h4. Menus and Windows

h5(#simplify). Simplified user interface

Hides commands and portions of windows that are not frequently
needed.

h5(#noautoclose). Don't automatically close windows

Prevents a window from closing when the process running inside it
has quit.

h5(#noautonew). Don't create new windows automatically

Prevents a new shell from being created if MacTelnet is activated
while it has no windows open.

h5(#usetabs). Use tabs to arrange windows

Once enabled, all new windows (but not existing ones) will use
tabs.

MacTelnet tabs are quite unique, in that they are still windows.
Aside from being "glued" together and having a tab adornment,
they are separate windows, so they retain a lot of flexibility.
For example, a sheet open on one tab will not block other tabs.

Currently, new tabs always appear in the most recently created
"workspace".  By default there is one workspace, but clicking a
tab or selecting Window >> Move to New Workspace will separate
the tab into its own workspace, and that workspace becomes the
new default for future tabs.

h4. Text

h5(#invert). Invert selected text

Uses high contrast colors for text selections instead of trying
to create a blend with the current window color scheme.

h5(#autocopy). Automatically Copy selected text

Whenever new text is highlighted, it is copied to the Clipboard.
This is how Unix-like systems behave, and may be how you are
accustomed to working with terminal-based applications.

h5(#dropmove). Move cursor to text drop location

Displays a ghost terminal cursor during drags, and sends a series
of arrow key sequences to move the cursor when the drag ends.

When terminal applications properly respond to the sequences, the
result is effectively to give them Mac-like drag-and-drop!

However, not all terminal applications properly respond to arrow
key sequences.  The typical error is to display various "garbage"
characters instead of moving the cursor.

h5(#nodim). Don't dim background terminal text

To help emphasize the active terminal, MacTelnet alters the color
hues of background windows.  Use this option to quell recoloring.

h4. Keyboard

h5(#menukeys). Menu item key equivalents

Disabling the key equivalents for all menu items is recommended
when in kiosk (Full Screen) mode, or whenever it is necessary to
use keys from menu commands as input to the application in the
active terminal.

h5(#mapbackquote). Map backquote key to escape character

On many keyboards, the backquote key is in a location similar to
or identical to the location of the Esc key on other keyboards.
Some users may wish to treat backquote keypresses as if they were
escape keypresses for this reason, especially if using something
that relies heavily on Esc such as the "vi" text editor.

Note, however, that Unix shells and other applications may
require use of a backquote.

h5(#focusfollowsmouse). Focus follows mouse

Allows you to type into any terminal without bringing its window
to the front; you simply point at the terminal with the mouse
before typing.  This is the way many window managers behave on
Unix-like systems.

h3(#generalspecial). Special

h4(#cursorflash). Terminal Cursor: Flashing

The cursor blinks on and off periodically when Flashing is set,
which may make it easier to see.  But, see also the Find Cursor
command in the Edit menu, which locates the cursor on demand.

h4(#cursorshape). Terminal Cursor: Shape

MacTelnet allows one of 5 different shapes for the terminal
cursor; a solid square is typical, but you may wish to have the
standard Mac vertical bar, a horizontal underline, or thicker
versions of either (more noticeable on LCD displays).

h4(#stackorigin). Window Stacking Origin

You can specify the location on the screen where the first
MacTelnet window is placed.  Subsequent windows automatically
stack diagonally.  Note that if you save a session or an entire
workspace, window locations are preserved and ignore this origin.

h4(#spacesfortab). Window Resize Effect

When window resizes affect terminal screen size, MacTelnet
dynamically calculates the maximum number of rows and columns
that can fit in the current window size (at current font size).

When window resizes affect text size, MacTelnet dynamically
calculates the maximum font size that can be used (in the current
terminal font) to fit the current number of rows and columns in
the current window size.

You can hold down the Option key prior to starting a window
resize to temporarily switch this preference.

h4(#spacesfortab). Copy With Tab Substitution: Spaces Per Tab

When copying text using Copy With Tab Substitution, this number
determines how many consecutive spaces are replaced with a single
tab character before putting the text on the clipboard.

h4(#commandN). Command-N Key Equivalent

MacTelnet has several ways to create sessions, and you may wish
to use one of them more than others.  You can map command-N as a
short-cut to whichever one you use most.

h3(#generalnotification). Notification

h4. Terminal Bell

h5. Sound

When a terminal audio event occurs, you can have MacTelnet ignore
it, or play the standard system beep, or any other library sound.

The set of sounds in the menu is defined the first time the
Preferences window opens, based on the contents of any Sounds
folders found in /System/Library, /Library, or the Library folder
of your Home folder.

Note that sound can also be controlled in individual terminals by
using the "Bell" command in the Terminal menu (or the
corresponding toolbar item).

h5(#visualbell). Always use visual bell

If a terminal window is not active, any bell events from the
window (regardless of sound settings) will include a visual flash
to show you which window the bell came from.

However, you can choose to enable visuals all the time, in which
case even active terminals will flash when bells occur.

h5(#marginbell). Margin bell

Not implemented.  But it will eventually, if enabled, generate a
terminal bell event if you are typing and the cursor passes into
the last 5 columns of the display.

h5(#notifybeeps). Background notification on bell

If MacTelnet is not the active application, you can ask that you
receive special notification from the OS when one of your
terminals generates a bell.

h4(#notifymethod). Background Notification

For "Background notification on bell", as well as any other alert
that may show up when you are in another application (such as an
error message), you can specify how "annoying" MacTelnet may be.
The options range from no interruptions at all, to an immediate
alert in your other application telling you that MacTelnet needs
your attention.

h2(#sessions). Sessions

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Sessions, a drawer appears showing all the
collections you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the
drawer and then edit settings in the main Preferences window for
that collection.

Sessions define how MacTelnet accesses a resource (a local or
remote terminal application), as well as other settings like key
mappings and the TEK graphics mode.  These are a little like
Bookmarks from your web browser, in that they allow you to easily
return to the things you use frequently.

h2(#macros). Macros

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Macros, a drawer appears showing all the macro
sets you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the drawer
and then edit settings in the main Preferences window for that
macro set.

All macro sets use the same key equivalents, so only one set can
be available at a time.  When a terminal window is active, use
the Map menu to choose the current macro set.

h3. Options

h4. Invoke With

h5. Command + keypad

Macros are invoked by combining the command (cloverleaf) key and
keypad keys such as numbers.

h5. Function keys

Macros are invoked using the first twelve function keys at the
top of your keyboard.

h4. User Interface

h5. Display as menu

Macros are always available from the keyboard, but this option
displays them in a top-level menu as well.  The menu changes as
you swap macro sets with the Map menu.

h3. Editing

A macro contains only plain text.  To edit, click on its content
portion in the list, and then hover until an edit box appears.
Hit Return or Enter when finished editing.

The name column can be edited in a similar way.  Note that macro
names are currently only used when a macro menu is displayed.

MacTelnet does allow you to put several special codes into the
content of macros, representing additional characters:

|_<{padding-right:0.5em}. Code|_<{padding-left:0.5em}. Meaning|
|<. \"|<{padding-left:0.5em}. double-quote (")|
|<. \\|<{padding-left:0.5em}. backslash (\)|
|<. \t|<{padding-left:0.5em}. horizontal tab|
|<. \r|<{padding-left:0.5em}. carriage return|
|<. \n|<{padding-left:0.5em}. line feed|
|<. \e|<{padding-left:0.5em}. escape (^[)|
|<. \0nn|<{padding-left:0.5em}. arbitrary ASCII in octal; e.g. "\004" is ^D|

bq. To see the octal versions of all ASCII characters, look at
<a href="x-man-page://ascii">x-man-page://ascii</a> (opens a MacTelnet window and runs "man ascii").

MacTelnet also recognizes codes that represent information to be
inserted at the time a macro is actually used:

|<. \i|<{padding-left:0.5em}. dynamically substitute an IP address of the computer|
|<. \#|<{padding-left:0.5em}. dynamically substitute the number of terminal lines|

h2(#translations). Translations

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Translations, a drawer appears showing all the
collections you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the
drawer and then edit settings in the main Preferences window for
that collection.

A translation table eessentially allows the terminal to display
text the way it is supposed to, according to what an application
in a terminal expects.

The Map menu allows you to choose any of these translation tables
while sessions are running.

h3. Base Translation Table

Since translation tables are large and cumbersome, and it is
common to customize small parts of existing character sets, you
can choose a table on which to base your customizations.

Alternatively, if you want to set up a collection that contains
exactly what is in a standard table, simply choose the standard
table and then avoid setting up Exceptions, below.

h3. Exceptions

For one or more characters in the selected base table, you can
specify alternate mappings by adding them to the Exceptions list.

For example, you could start with a United States character set
and add an exception that changes "#" to the British symbol for
pounds.

h2(#terminals). Terminals

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Terminals, a drawer appears showing all the
collections you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the
drawer and then edit settings in the main Preferences window for
that collection.

Terminals decide somewhat technical aspects of a window, such as
the emulation type.  Usually, you set up one or more of these
with the help of an administrator or the documentation for your
terminal application, so that MacTelnet behaves correctly when
you access that terminal application.  When you create a custom
or Favorite session, you can associate a Terminal Favorite with
it, ensuring these important settings are always made for you.

h2(#formats). Formats

You can create more than one set of preferences in this category.
When you select Formats, a drawer appears showing all the formats
you have.  Simply choose a name from the list in the drawer and
then edit settings in the main Preferences window for that
format.

Formats are collects of fonts, font sizes, colors, and more, that
decide how your terminal windows look.  You can use the View menu
to quickly change a window's format to one of the Favorites you
specify in Preferences, or to make customizations local to the
frontmost window.

h3. Normal

Settings that apply to all text, unless overridden by some more
specific property.

Color settings have two entries, the leftmost box is the text
(foreground) color and the rightmost box is the background color.

h3. ANSI Colors

Terminal applications can rely on an ANSI standard palette of
colors.  While it is a good idea to choose colors that match the
specified names, sometimes you have to change them so they don't
clash with your other customizations!

Color settings have two entries, the leftmost box is the "normal"
version and the rightmost box is the "bold" (or emphasized) one.
Ordinarily, the bold color is a slightly brighter version of the
normal color.

Not all applications in terminals will make use of these colors.
In addition, a Terminal Favorite can disable them.

h2(#macros). Full Screen

Settings that control "kiosk mode", the Full Screen command in
the View menu.  You can use these preferences to create a more
complete kiosk (by hiding the menu bar, for example).

h3. Options

h4. Access Control

h5. Show menu bar when mouse is near it

The menu bar is hidden in Full Screen mode, but it can normally
be displayed simply by moving the mouse to the top of the screen
and pausing a moment.

If you want the menu bar to be completely unusable, disable this
option and also disable the "Menu key equivalents" option in the
General category.

h5. Show scroll bar

If your goal is to run an application in the terminal window for
visitors of a kiosk, it may be appropriate to hide the scroll bar
so that none of the "junk" normally cached in the scrollback is
accessible.

h5. Allow "Force Quit" command

To make kiosks harder to mess with, you can prevent the user from
accessing the system Force Quit function.

Note that this offers "pretty good" security, but does not guard
against all possible ways that MacTelnet could be interrupted.
For example, a background application could pop up, MacTelnet
could crash, or the user may be able to command-Tab to some other
program.

h4. Effects

h5. Superfluous graphical effects

In full screen mode, MacTelnet has significantly more screen
resolution and therefore has more options for rendering terminals
in interesting ways!  If you do not want kiosks to look
significantly different from normal terminal windows, disable
this option.

h4. Deactivation

h5. Display an "off switch" window

If you do not want your kiosk disturbed, you may wish to remove
the floating button that appears by default.  (Full Screen can
always be disabled, but without this button it is less likely
that visitors will determine how.)

h2(#scripts). Scripts

This panel provides easy access to your Scripts Menu Items and
will make more scripting options available in the future.
