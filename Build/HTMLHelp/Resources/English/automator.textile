h1(pagetitle). Using Automator with MacTerm

notextile. <div class="content">

p(#abstract). MacTerm support for Automator is currently limited, however
 there are ways to use existing actions that you may not have
 realized.

h2(#urls). Opening Sessions With URLs

The default Internet actions in Automator (Mac OS X 10.4+) are
 often named or described in terms of web pages, but in fact they
 are general: opening sessions for URLs that MacTerm supports.

A simple workflow in Automator would be to connect (from the
 Internet category) "Get Specified URLs" to "Display Webpages".

Automator will call on MacTerm if MacTerm is the default
 application for a particular type of URL.  Otherwise, different
 applications will handle the URL.  (3rd party software such as
 "Default Apps" can change the URL mappings on your system.)

MacTerm can handle several kinds of URLs, including:

* file
* ftp
* rlogin
* sftp (non-standard)
* ssh (non-standard)
* telnet
* x-man-page (non-standard)

It is also possible to add or change URL handlers, through the
 lower-level Python API in MacTerm.  For instance, you could add
 a handler that runs a terminal-based browser for "http" URLs.
