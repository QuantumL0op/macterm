h1(pagetitle). Using Automator with MacTelnet

notextile. <div class="content">

p(#abstract). MacTelnet support for Automator is currently limited, however
there are ways to use existing actions that you may not have
realized.

h2(#urls). Opening Sessions With URLs

The default Internet actions in Automator (Mac OS X 10.4+) are
often named or described in terms of web pages, but in fact they
are general: opening sessions for URLs that MacTelnet supports.

A simple workflow in Automator would be to connect (from the
Internet category) "Get Specified URLs" to "Display Webpages".

Automator will call on MacTelnet if MacTelnet is the default
application for a particular type of URL.  Otherwise, different
applications will handle the URL.  (3rd party software such as
"Default Apps" can change the URL mappings on your system.)

MacTelnet can handle several kinds of URLs, including:

* file
* ftp
* rlogin
* sftp (non-standard)
* ssh (non-standard)
* telnet
* x-man-page (non-standard)

It is also possible to add or change URL handlers, through the
lower-level Python API in MacTelnet.  For instance, you could add
a handler that runs a terminal-based browser for "http" URLs.
