h1(pagetitle). Using Growl Notifications with MacTerm

notextile. <div class="content">

p(#abstract). MacTerm provides several different types of notifications that
 you can fully customize with the "Growl":http://www.growl.info/ infrastructure.

h2(#customizing). Customizing Notifications

To view or customize MacTerm notifications, first install Growl
 on your computer, then open your "System Preferences" panel,
 "Growl" panel.  From there, click the "Applications" tab, and
 double-click "MacTerm" in the list.  (If MacTerm does not appear
 yet, you may have to run MacTerm first.)  Finally, click the
 "Notifications" tab.

h2(#notificationtypes). Types of Notifications

h3. Session active

This notification applies whenever the Terminal menu in MacTerm
 has been used to activate "Notify on Next Activity".

When new data arrives in any monitored terminal window that is
 not in front, this notification is sent.  You might use this if a
 window is watching a log file (say) and you want to notice when
 something new appears.

MacTerm normally displays a modeless alert for this type of
 notification, but the alert is automatically hidden if Growl is
 installed on your computer.  Instead, use Growl to make this
 notification look however you want!

h3. Session ended

This is sent when a session ends successfully, by its main Unix
 process exiting with a zero status.  Any other exit status,
 including signals (such as a crash or killed process), will not
 trigger this notification.

MacTerm does not have any default behavior for this event; you
 only see it if you use Growl to display a custom notification.

h3. Session failed

This is sent when a session ends in failure (by its main Unix
 process exiting with a nonzero status), or when an abnormal
 signal kills the process.  Certain signals do *not* fire this
 event, such as manually closing the window to kill the process.

MacTerm normally displays a modeless alert for this type of
 notification, but the alert is automatically hidden if Growl is
 installed on your computer.  Instead, use Growl to make this
 notification look however you want!

h3. Session idle

This notification applies whenever the Terminal menu in MacTerm
 has been used to activate "Notify on Inactivity".

When no data has arrived for awhile in any monitored terminal
 window that is not in front, this notification is sent.  You
 might use this to be reminded when a long-running program has
 apparently finished.

MacTerm normally displays a modeless alert for this type of
 notification, but the alert is automatically hidden if Growl is
 installed on your computer.  Instead, use Growl to make this
 notification look however you want!

h2. Notification Clicks

Currently, MacTerm does not care if you click a notification,
 they are just for your information.
