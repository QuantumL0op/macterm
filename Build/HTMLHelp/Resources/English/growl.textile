h1(pagetitle). Using Growl Notifications with MacTelnet

<div class="content">

p(#abstract). MacTelnet provides several different types of notifications that
you can fully customize with the "Growl":http://www.growl.info/ infrastructure.

h2(#notificationtypes). Customizing Notifications

To view or customize MacTelnet notifications, first install Growl
on your computer (Mac OS X 10.4 or later), then open your
"System Preferences" panel, "Growl" panel.  From there, click the
"Applications" tab, and double-click "MacTelnet" in the list.
(If MacTelnet does not appear yet, you may have to run MacTelnet
first.)  Finally, click the "Notifications" tab.

h2(#notificationtypes). Types of Notifications

h3. Session active

This notification applies whenever the Terminal menu in MacTelnet
has been used to activate "Notify on Next Activity".  (The menu
is not visible if "Simplified user interface" on.)

When new data arrives in any monitored terminal window that is
not in front, this notification is sent.  You might use this if a
window is watching a log file (say) and you want to notice when
something new appears.

MacTelnet normally displays a modeless alert for this type of
notification, but the alert is automatically hidden if Growl is
installed on your computer.  Instead, use Growl to make this
notification look however you want!

h3. Session ended

This is sent when a session ends successfully, by its main Unix
process exiting with a zero status.  Any other exit status,
including signals (such as a crash or killed process), will not
trigger this notification.

MacTelnet does not have any default behavior for this event; you
only see it if you use Growl to display a custom notification.

h3. Session failed

This is sent when a session ends in failure (by its main Unix
process exiting with a nonzero status), or when an abnormal
signal kills the process.  Certain signals do *not* fire this
event, such as manually closing the window to kill the process.

MacTelnet normally displays a modeless alert for this type of
notification, but the alert is automatically hidden if Growl is
installed on your computer.  Instead, use Growl to make this
notification look however you want!

h3. Session idle

This notification applies whenever the Terminal menu in MacTelnet
has been used to activate "Notify on Inactivity".  (The menu is
not visible if "Simplified user interface" on.)

When no data has arrived for awhile in any monitored terminal
window that is not in front, this notification is sent.  You
might use this to be reminded when a long-running program has
apparently finished.

MacTelnet normally displays a modeless alert for this type of
notification, but the alert is automatically hidden if Growl is
installed on your computer.  Instead, use Growl to make this
notification look however you want!

h2. Notification Clicks

Currently, MacTelnet does not care if you click a notification,
they are just for your information.
