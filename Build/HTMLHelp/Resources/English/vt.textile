h2(#vt100). General

Each application running in a terminal must be told the type of
emulator that is in use, so that appropriate requests are sent
when rendering.

If a program is run directly by MacTelnet (such as a shell or
"ssh"), the "TERM" variable will be preset by MacTelnet to match
the emulator selected for that window.

However, there are cases where you may have to set this yourself:

* if you ask MacTelnet to change the emulator of a window
* if you connect to a remote server that has its own method for
  setting the terminal type (e.g. different operating system)
* if there are defects in the active emulator and you want to try
  a different one (e.g. downgrading from "vt102" to "vt100")

In Mac OS X and other Unix-like operating systems, you typically
are running a shell where the "TERM" variable can be changed.

In most shells, you use this form:

pre. export TERM=vt100

In the "tcsh" or "csh" shell, you use this form:

pre. setenv TERM vt100

You can set "TERM" to any value that is understood by the
applications you run in a terminal.  Usually, this matches an
actual terminal name; common values are:

pre. vt100 vt102 vt220 xterm xterm-color linux

But, it can also be set to other names that are considered
compatible (more or less) with one of MacTelnet's own emulators.

h2(#vt100). VT100

MacTelnet has a very accurate VT100 terminal emulator, including
the VT52 mode of the VT100.  The main flaws right now relate to
rendering of double-sized text in certain situations.

h2(#vt102). VT102

The VT102 is almost entirely the same as the VT100, but with
enhanced editing and printing features.  MacTelnet handles the
additional editing features, and has an implementation of the
printing features that is currently unreliable and is under test.

h2(#vt220). VT220

The VT220 is a superset of the VT100 series.  MacTelnet has an
implementation of this emulator, but in development versions it
is largely disabled for testing.

You can use the Window menu to access key palettes for a number
of VT220 terminal features.

h2(#vt320). VT320

The VT320 is a superset of the VT220.  MacTelnet does not support
this terminal type (yet).

h2(#vt420). VT420

The VT420 is a superset of the VT320.  MacTelnet does not support
this terminal type (yet).

h2(#xterm). XTerm

The XTerm is a superset of the VT100 series that is notable for
window management features like minimization, size, and title, as
well as mouse support.  MacTelnet has an implementation of some
XTerm features, but in development versions they are largely
disabled for testing.

These days, the more common variant is the color XTerm.  16 basic
colors are supported by all MacTelnet terminals.

h2(#linux). Linux

The Linux terminal is a superset of the color XTerm.  MacTelnet
does not support this terminal type (yet).

h2(#ansibbs). ANSI-BBS

The ANSI-BBS terminal type has many names, and is perhaps best
described as the MS-DOS terminal.  The feature set is not entirely
standardized, however it is known for using Code Page 437 extended
ASCII as its character set.  PC console applications commonly rely
on this to do relatively sophisticated graphics rendering.
MacTelnet has a preliminary implementation of this emulator, but
in development versions it is largely disabled for testing.
