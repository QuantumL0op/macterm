h1(pagetitle). Low-Level Settings

<div class="content">

This page describes preferences that generally require special
edits to make.  For example, you may need to use the command-line
"defaults" program, or edit XML directly, instead of interacting
with a window in MacTelnet.

This document is very incomplete and will be expanded over time.

h2(#general). General

MacTelnet preferences are hierarchical.  Every default value is
in "com.mactelnet.MacTelnet.plist" (in the Preferences folder of
the user Library folder), even if it appears to be a Default
collection in the user interface.

Collections themselves are separate property list files, of the form
"com.mactelnet.MacTelnet.[type].[number].plist".  The names
of these domains are recorded in the primary defaults file.

Each collection file contains either a "name" key of type Data,
or a "name-string" key of type String, or both.  The String
version is less precise, but is useful for easy viewing and
debugging of names.  The Data version is preferred and is an
external representation of Unicode.  These names determine how
MacTelnet displays the collection in any user interface, such as
a menu or a list in the Preferences window.

MacTelnet settings are designed so that *any* preferences key
might one day fit into any collection.  However, currently, only
related settings are actually expected; for instance, nothing
will check for colors in a Session collection.
