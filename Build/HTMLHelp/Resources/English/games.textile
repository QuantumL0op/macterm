h1(pagetitle). Playing BBS Games

<div class="content">

p(#abstract). While it is possible to configure MacTelnet to work well with
typical games, the defaults will not work well at all!  This
tutorial will help you make settings appropriate for most games.

h2. Overview

Historically, many so-called BBS (Bulletin Board System) games,
also known as MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons), expect to work on PCs
under DOS.  They also typically rely on non-standard extensions
to the VT100 terminal, that collectively are known as ANSI-BBS.

MacTelnet's default VT100 emulator has a few of the common
extensions that make it compatible with ANSI-BBS.  It also knows
how to translate characters from other character sets (DOS has
its own character set), and special graphics characters are
rendered with high quality.

h2. Configuration

h3. Translation

First, you must create a Translation collection (via Preferences)
that uses the same characters as DOS typically does, such as
special graphics.

* Open the Preferences window, and go to the Translations pane.
* Either edit the default, or (recommended) use the "+" button in
  the drawer to create a new collection.
* Select "Latin-US (DOS)" from the "Characters:" list.

The list is based on what translation units are installed on your
computer.  While the DOS set is always available on Mac OS X when
sold in the U.S., it may not exist in international versions.

If you acquired a translation unit in some other way, it may have
some other name (such as, CP437 for Code Page 437).

h3. Format

While you do not have to change fonts or colors (configured in
Format preferences), you should be aware of some side effects.

One, there is currently a bug in MacTelnet where any font that is
not natively encoded as Mac Roman, may incorrectly display some
international characters.  If your game relies on things like
accented characters, be sure to choose a more basic font (like
Monaco).

Two, MacTelnet automatically chooses a different color for text
or backgrounds that are considered "bold" and "blinking".  If you
do not want this effect, you should configure the Format that you
use to have the same colors for bold, blinking, and normal text.

Three, if you have customized any of the 16 "ANSI Colors" in a
Format, note that games often draw graphics assuming that the
original colors are in use.  The "Set to the Standard Colors..."
button on the "ANSI Colors" tab of the Formats pane allows you to
make these 16 colors return to their expected defaults for a PC.

Four, MacTelnet supports up to 256 colors, but programs that may
use them will often only attempt to do so when the terminal is
identified as "xterm-256color".  Note that you cannot customize
these 256 colors, except for the 16 that are in the "ANSI Colors"
subset.  (Do not worry about 256 colors unless you know that your
game can use them.)

h3. Terminal

You should have a Terminal set up in Preferences with a "Base
Emulator:" set to VT100.

MacTelnet automatically recognizes certain ANSI-specific add-ons
to VT100, so if a game uses them they will be handled correctly.

Note that some games assume that the screen size is 80 x 25.  If
necessary, ensure that the screen has these dimensions.

h3. Session

Your game could be hosted anywhere, though it is typically on a
remote server accessible via a simple telnet connection.  You
probably have a "telnet://" URL, or information on a server host
name and port number to use.

If you will play this game often, you should create a new Session
collection in Preferences.  Otherwise, you could enter the same
configuration information in the "Custom New Session" sheet.

When the Sessions pane (or sheet) is visible, you will see a
"Command:" field.  Either directly type in the telnet command or
other command needed to reach the game, or use the button
"Connect to Server..." to help you compose a command.

The pane also has pop-up menus that will let you choose the
Terminal, Format and Translation that you created above.  This
causes appropriate defaults to be set before the server is even
contacted.

Note that "environment variables" on the server side sometimes
need to be manually synchronized with MacTelnet settings.  Talk
to a server administrator to determine if this is true in your
case.

h2. Game Play

Some MacTelnet features are particularly well suited to games.

The "No window close on process exit" preference prevents windows
from immediately closing at disconnect time.  Many game servers
display information during logout that would otherwise disappear
immediately.

The "Full Screen" command in the MacTelnet application menu lets
you focus entirely on the game.  Depending on the current setting
of "Window Resize Effect", this may either change the font or
the terminal size; hold down the Option key to temporarily do the
opposite as you enter Full Screen.

The "Command Line" window can be displayed using the Window menu.
This allows you to type text that is only sent to the server when
you press Return (or Enter).  It also maintains a history of the
commands entered from that window.

The Macros pane in the Preferences window can be used to create
sets of predefined actions mapped to keys (that can then be
enabled using the Map menu).
