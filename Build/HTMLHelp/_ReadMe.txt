MacTelnet Help is generated from Python source as
well as some simple key:value files that define
symbolically the HTML head elements (meta tags,
etc.).

See the Tools directory for more on how this input
is actually used.

The textile Python tool defines the format - its
documentation has specific details, but the basic
idea is for the source to be as simple as possible
(even simpler than HTML).  Documentation on
textile is available if you run "pydoc textile"
from Tools/textile-2.0.10.
