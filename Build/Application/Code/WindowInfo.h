/*!	\file WindowInfo.h
	\brief Attaches auxiliary data to Mac OS windows to make
	them easier to deal with generically.
	
	NOTE:   This module is deprecated on Mac OS X.  It was made
			originally to address serious deficiencies in the
			Window Manager and other toolbox APIs, but any
			Mac OS X application can use other methods to do
			the things Window Info does.
