	Growl Registration Ticket.growlRegDict
	
	MacTelnet 4.0
	Â© 1998-2009 by Kevin Grant
	
	This file is used to configure Growl.  See "http://www.growl.info/".
	(All possible key values are described in "GrowlDefines.h".)
	
	The file name actually requires spaces, but those are a pain to deal
	with in scripts.  So, this file is renamed when it is copied into the
	final application bundle.
