Since there are differences between Growl and Mac OS X in
terms of flexibility, this setting allows the sender of a
notification to specify how it is intended to be seen by
the user.  In certain situations a notification may
intentionally NOT be sent to Mac OS X simply because it
does not offer the user the same options as Growl to
display the notification in a sensible way.
