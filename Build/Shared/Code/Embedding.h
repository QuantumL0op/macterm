	\brief Greatly simplified use of offscreen graphics worlds,
	with particular attention to (human interface) control
	embedding hierarchies.
	
	The Embedding module allows you to use offscreen graphics
	worlds easily, automatically taking into account multiple
	monitors and automatically using the best technology
	available to perform the graphics swapping.  You can perform
	offscreen operations on a *per-control* basis, which allows
	you to draw entire windows (using a root control) or parts
	of a window (via a user pane) via offscreen graphics worlds.
	
	There are also miscellaneous other utility routines that
	make use of offscreen graphics worlds to function.

Offscreen Operation Method

An offscreen operation method should perform all
necessary changes to controls in a window.  The
Embedding_OffscreenControlOperation() routine
will always try to save the entire specified
control for a window in its buffer, so there is
no need for an offscreen operation method to draw
a control unless it is going to change its
appearance in some way.  You generally write
offscreen operation methods that perform a number
of collective tasks on controls, such as setting
the enabled state of more than one control.  Both
pieces of data provided to this method are
arbitrary, and specified when the method
Embedding_OffscreenControlOperation() is called.

Do not call DeviceLoop() in your routine; this
method is designed to provide you with all of
the information that DeviceLoop() would normally
provide.
