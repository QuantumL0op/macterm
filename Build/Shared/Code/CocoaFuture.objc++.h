/*!	\file CocoaFuture.h
	\brief Declarations for certain constants and methods
	available only on newer OSes, to aid compilations for
	older OSes.
	
	It is very important that these be based on the exact
	definitions in later SDKs.  Symbols should be added
	only if they are already set, e.g. a constant whose
	value is now established in old OS versions or a
	selector that is already implemented for a class.
	
	You MUST use "respondsToSelector:" or an equivalent
	mechanism to guard against use of these methods on
	older OSes.  The advantage of importing this file is
	that you can directly invoke the target method (in
	if-statements, say) without seeing compiler warnings.
