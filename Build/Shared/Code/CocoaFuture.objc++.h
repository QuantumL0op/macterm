/*!
Methods that are implemented ONLY on Mac OS X 10.5 and beyond.
These declarations should match the latest SDK.

WARNING:	You MUST use "respondsToSelector:" or an equivalent
			mechanism to guard against use of these methods on
			older OSes.  The advantage of importing this method
			is that you can directly invoke the target method
			(in an if-statement, say) without seeing compiler
			warnings.  Note that "performSelector:" is also an
			option, but that is much more cumbersome for APIs
			that take or return non-objects.
