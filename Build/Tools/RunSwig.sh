# RunSwig.sh
#
# Runs the SWIG program to construct source code out of a SWIG
# interface file (ultimately for Python).
#
# This should be invoked from Xcode, or the environment should
# otherwise provide what Xcode does for build rules: in
# particular, variables like ${INPUT_FILE_BASE}.  For more
# information, see "Xcode Build System Guide: Build Rules".
#
# This script exists to act as an interface to Xcode build rules,
# and to correct some stupid things that SWIG does.
