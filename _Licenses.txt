                     MacTerm Source Licenses           2005-04-12

The copyright holder of all recent versions of MacTerm and
MacTelnet is Kevin M. Grant, as detailed in "About MacTerm".

Note that each source code file clearly marks (at the top) the
license that is applicable to the file.  Each file has only ONE
applicable license even if the project allows multiple licenses.

In general, library code in "Build/Shared" is more liberally
licensed than the terminal's own code in "Build/Application".

MAIN SOURCE CODE LICENSE
  MacTerm is free software; you may distribute it or modify it
  under the terms of the GNU General Public License, either
  version 2 of the license or (at your option) a later version.
  
  A copy of the GPL license is in Licenses/.

GENERIC CODE LICENSE
  All application-independent code (clearly identified) is free
  library code, which is under the less-restricting terms of
  the GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1.  This
  allows companies, for instance, more freedom to benefit from
  at least some of MacTerm's code.
  
  A copy of the LPL license is in Licenses/.

"MAAttachedWindow" LICENSE
  The "Build/Shared/Code/Popover.mm" and "Popover.objc++.h" files
  (formerly "MAAttachedWindow.m" and "MAAttachedWindow.h" but
  extensively modified) are so modified under the terms of the
  license from Matt Gemmell.

  A copy of Matt Gemmell's license is in Licenses/.
