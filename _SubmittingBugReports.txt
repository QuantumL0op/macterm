REPORTING BUGS
  You are welcome to submit via E-mail to "kmg@mac.com".
  
  Due to recent infrastructure changes at SourceForge there is
  currently no web page for logging bug reports in a more
  official manner.  This may change; you can access the project
  page here:
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/mactelnet/
  
  Please see http://macterm.net/bug-reporter/ for a variety of
  advice on submitting useful bug reports.
