REPORTING BUGS
  You are welcome to submit via E-mail to "kmg@mac.com".
  
  Issues have not been formally tracked in awhile, ever since
  SourceForge dropped its Trac support.  Since the project has
  recently moved to GitHub, issue-tracking may resume there;
  check "https://github.com/kmgrant/macterm/issues" periodically.
  
  Please see http://www.macterm.net/bug-reporter/ for a variety
  of advice on submitting useful bug reports.
